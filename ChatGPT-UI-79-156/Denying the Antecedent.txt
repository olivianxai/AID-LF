\#classification: Denying the Antecedent#

For Denying the Antecedent:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains a conditional statement: "If it barks, it is a dog" (If P then Q)
Step 2 evaluation: No - The antecedent ("it barks") is denied: "It doesn’t bark"
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion is drawn that "it’s not a dog" based on the denial of the antecedent

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/No/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/No/Yes]
