\#classification: Conjunction Fallacy#

For Conjunction Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement involves probability estimates, as it concludes Mr. Pius is “more likely to be Catholic than a Catholic or a Muslim.”
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The phrase “Catholic or Muslim” is a conjunction combining two events.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion that Mr. Pius is “more likely” to be just Catholic than to be Catholic or Muslim implies that the conjunction is less probable.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - “Catholic” is a subset of “Catholic or Muslim,” so logically it cannot be more probable.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The specific (Catholic) is being treated as more probable than the more general category (Catholic or Muslim).

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes]
