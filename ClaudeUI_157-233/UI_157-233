#classification: Use Mention Error# For Use Mention Error: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement involves the word "son" being discussed in relation to its letter composition Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The word itself (the mention of "son" as having letters) is being confused with what the word refers to (the actual son as a person) Step 3 evaluation: Yes - There are missing quotation marks - it should be "My 'son' is made up of five letters" to properly distinguish the word from the referent Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The statement treats "son" (the word) as equivalent to son (the actual person) Step 5 evaluation: Yes - This confusion between word and referent creates an invalid logical connection between the properties of words and people Step 6 evaluation: Yes - This error creates a false equivalence between linguistic properties and physical properties Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]
