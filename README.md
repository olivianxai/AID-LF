# Atomic-Instruction-Dataset-for-Logical-Fallacies (AID-LF)
This repo includes the dataset constructed to evaluate the LLMs' capability of following atomic instructions for Logical Fallacy Classification, from our paper "Follow My Lead: Logical Fallacy Classification with Knowledge-Augmented LLMs", which is in review for the Advances in Cognitive Systems conference. 

The original Fallacies dataset can be found here - https://github.com/Raising-hrx/FALLACIES/blob/main/fallacies.json.
