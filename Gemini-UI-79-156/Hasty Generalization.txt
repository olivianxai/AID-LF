For No True Scotsman:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A universal claim is made: "smoking really canâ€™t be that bad for you."
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - A counterexample is presented: the father smoked heavily and still lived to 69.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The example implicitly redefines what counts as "bad for you" to exclude this counterexample.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The definition of "bad for you" is implicitly narrowed without objective criteria to preserve the original claim.
