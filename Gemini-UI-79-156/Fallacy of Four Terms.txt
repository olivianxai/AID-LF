\#classification: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle#

For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is a categorical syllogism: "All cats are felines. All dogs are canines. Therefore, all cats are canines."
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (cats/felines and dogs/canines), but there is no shared middle term to logically connect cats and canines.
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning that justifies the conclusion.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/No] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/No]
