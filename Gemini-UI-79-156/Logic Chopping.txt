\#classification: Avoiding the Issue#

For Avoiding the Issue:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - John makes a clear request for help moving the car, which is a direct claim or request.
Step 2 evaluation: No - Paul never directly addresses the actual need to move the car; he diverts to philosophical or moral inquiries instead.
Step 3 evaluation: No - Paul introduces unrelated arguments (traffic, guilt, causation) rather than addressing Johnâ€™s request.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The original question about helping move the car remains unaddressed throughout the conversation.
