\#classification: Fake Precision#

For Fake Precision:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The tour guide makes a claim involving a precise numerical value (120,000,003 years).
Step 2 evaluation: No - The exactness of “120,000,003” is implausible given the tools (radiometric dating) and the context (round number from 3 years ago).
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The specificity of “3” added to 120,000,000 misleads by implying unjustified precision.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The misleading specificity (120,000,003) gives the impression of scientific rigor and strengthens the claim falsely.
