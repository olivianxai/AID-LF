\#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#

For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The question "How many times per day do you beat your wife?" is being asked.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question contains the built-in assumption that the person being asked does beat their wife.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The assumption is misleading because it presumes guilt without evidence or clarification.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The phrasing of the question protects the asker from direct accusation by embedding the presupposition.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Any direct answer would imply acceptance of the embedded assumption (that beating occurs).

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes]
