#classification: Denying a Conjunct#

For Denying a Conjunct:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims that both conditions (being a moron AND being an idiot) cannot be true at the same time
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims that one condition (being a moron) does not hold
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The argument concludes that the other condition (being an idiot) must be true
Step 4 evaluation: No - The conclusion is not supported by additional evidence beyond the logical structure

Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/N]
