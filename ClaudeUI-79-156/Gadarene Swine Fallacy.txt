#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#
For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a question being asked ("Why can't your daughter fall in line like the other girls?")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question contains the built-in assumption that the daughter is not falling in line like other girls
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - This assumption is misleading as it presupposes the daughter should conform and that she currently doesn't
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The question hides the claim that the daughter should fall in line, protecting the asker from having to directly state this position
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Answering this question would implicitly accept that the daughter should fall in line like other girls and that she currently doesn't
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]
