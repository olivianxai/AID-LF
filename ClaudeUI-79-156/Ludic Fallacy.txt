#classification: Ludic Fallacy#
For Ludic Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Dr. John uses statistical probability theory (50/50 coin flip odds) to support his claim
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The situation involves chaotic elements and real-world unpredictability that could affect the coin's fairness
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Dr. John's statistical model assumes perfect conditions (fair coin) that conflict with real-world complexity where a coin showing 99 heads might indicate bias
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Dr. John displays overconfidence in the statistical results by rigidly applying theoretical probability
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Dr. John ignores contextual factors like potential coin bias that Fat Tony considers
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]
