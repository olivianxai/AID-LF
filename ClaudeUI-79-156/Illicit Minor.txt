For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is structured as a categorical syllogism with two premises ("All Catholics are Christian" and "All Christians are Jesus lovers") and one conclusion ("Therefore, all Jesus lovers are Catholic")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (Catholics and Jesus lovers) to the same middle term (Christians), and the conclusion directly links Catholics and Jesus lovers
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning or evidence outside the premises that justifies the conclusion
