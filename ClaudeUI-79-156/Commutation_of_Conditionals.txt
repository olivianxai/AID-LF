#classification: Commutation of Conditionals#
For Commutation of Conditionals:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A statement is being made about the relationship between having a PhD and being smart
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement contains a conditional relationship "If I have a PhD, then I am smart" (if P then Q format)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The antecedent (having a PhD) and consequent (being smart) have been switched in the conclusion
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The switched antecedent-consequent "if I am smart, then I have a PhD" is assumed to be true
Step 5 evaluation: No - The switched antecedent-consequent (if Q then P) pair is not logically correct - the original conditional does not logically justify its converse
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/N]
