#classification: Hasty Generalization#
For Hasty Generalization:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The father's smoking experience is being used as evidence
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - One person's experience is an unreasonably small sample relative to the total population of smokers
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - One individual's experience is completely unrepresentative of the broader population of smokers
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - A broad conclusion about smoking's harmfulness is being drawn from this single case
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion is being applied to all people who smoke, a much larger population
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - The generalization ignores extensive statistical data and larger patterns showing smoking's health risks
