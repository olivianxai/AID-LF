#classification: Red Herring#

For Red Herring:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There are two arguments: Hank's claim about the squirrel causing the accident, and Officer Sam's suggestion about texting and drunk driving
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The arguments are unrelated - the squirrel explanation versus the texting/drunk driving causes are separate issues
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Hank deliberately introduces the squirrel argument rather than accidentally mentioning it
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - After Hank introduces the squirrel explanation, the original potential causes (texting/drunk driving) are ignored in his response
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Hank appears to be trying to divert attention from the real causes (texting/drunk driving) by focusing on the squirrel

Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]
