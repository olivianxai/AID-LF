#classification: Fallacy of Composition#
For Fallacy of Composition:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a part-to-whole relationship being discussed (individual bricks vs. the entire building)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - A property is attributed to the parts (each brick weighs less than a pound)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion claims the whole possesses the same property as the parts (the building weighs less than a pound)
Step 4 evaluation: No - The property of individual bricks weighing less than a pound does not necessarily transfer to the whole building
Step 5 evaluation: No - No additional valid reasoning or evidence is provided to justify the conclusion

Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/N/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/N/N]
