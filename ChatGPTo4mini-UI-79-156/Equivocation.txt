\#classification: Ambiguity Fallacy#

For Ambiguity Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – “gay” in “make the yuletide gay” is ambiguous between “joyful” and “homosexual.”
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – this ambiguous phrase is used to support the conclusion (refusal to enjoy the holiday).
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – the refusal relies solely on interpreting “gay” as sexual preference.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – that shift in meaning undermines the connection between the premise and conclusion.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – if “gay” is understood as “happy,” the argument fails.
