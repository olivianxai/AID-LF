\#classification: Survivorship Fallacy#

For Survivorship Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – the argument draws a conclusion based on the single example of the father surviving despite heavy smoking.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – it implicitly contrasts the surviving father with those who didn’t “survive” long enough to be cited.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – only the survivor’s case is considered, excluding those who suffered smoking-related deaths.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – it ignores the experiences of smokers who died earlier from smoking-related causes.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – it generalizes from this lone survivor’s experience to conclude smoking “can’t be that bad.”

Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]
