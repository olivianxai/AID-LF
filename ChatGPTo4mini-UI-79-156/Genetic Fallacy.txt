For Genetic Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – the argument evaluates the truth of whether people are generally good.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – it centers on the origin (Lisa’s childhood brainwashing) of the belief.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – the conclusion that people aren’t generally good is drawn solely from that origin.
Step 4 evaluation: No – the origin (brainwashing) is irrelevant to the actual truth of people’s goodness.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – it follows “This belief stems from brainwashing, therefore it’s false.”
