\#classification: Homunculus Fallacy#

For Homunculus Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – the phenomenon of how eyes project an image to the brain is identified as needing explanation
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – the “little guy in your brain watching the movie” is offered as the explanation
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – this explanation invokes the same phenomenon (a watcher in the brain) it’s meant to explain
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – it creates a circular explanation by relying on the phenomenon itself to explain itself
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – it leads to an infinite regress, asking what watches the watcher ad infinitum
Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]
