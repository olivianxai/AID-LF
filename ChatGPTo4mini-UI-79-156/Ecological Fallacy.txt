\#classification: Ecological Fallacy#

For Ecological Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – The argument begins with a statistical claim about a group (“Men score better on math than women do”).
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – It then discusses an individual from that group (“Jerry is a man”).
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – It concludes Jerry must share the group’s characteristic (“Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman”) based solely on the group statistic.
Step 4 evaluation: No – No substantial evidence is provided about Jerry’s own math ability.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes, yes, yes, no] exactly match ground truth \[yes, yes, yes, no]
