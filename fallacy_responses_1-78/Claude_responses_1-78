When the police officer asks him, \"At what point did you shoot the clerk?\" Bill replies in shock, \"I shot the clerk? I shot the clerk?\" Later in the film, the police officer reads Bill's statement as a confession in court, \"...and he said, 'I shot the clerk. I shot the clerk.

LLM:
#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#
For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a question being asked ("At what point did you shoot the clerk?")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question contains the built-in assumption that Bill shot the clerk
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - This assumption is misleading as it presumes guilt without establishing it
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The question hides the claim that Bill is guilty to avoid direct accusation
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Any answer would implicitly accept that Bill shot the clerk, even his shocked repetition

Systematic Fallacy Analysis
Example Text:
"In programming CGI, a WYSIWYG interface doesn't handle PHP or CSS very well. If you sign up for my personal consulting, I will show you how to program effectively."
Analysis Process:
Let me systematically evaluate this against each fallacy in the knowledge base.
Testing Red Herring:

Step 1: Is there more than one argument being presented? Yes - There's an argument about WYSIWYG interfaces and CGI programming, then a separate argument about personal consulting
Step 2: Are those arguments unrelated or only tangentially related? Yes - The technical statement about WYSIWYG interfaces is only loosely connected to the consulting offer
Step 3: Is the introduction of Argument B deliberate rather than accidental? Yes - The consulting offer appears deliberately introduced
Step 4: Is the original argument (Argument A) abandoned or ignored after Argument B is introduced? Yes - The technical issue is not resolved, just followed by the consulting pitch
Step 5: Does the person introducing Argument B seem to be trying to divert attention from the original argument A? Yes - The consulting offer diverts from addressing the technical problem

Pattern: Y/Y/Y/Y/Y matches ground truth: Y/Y/Y/Y/Y ✓
Testing Non Sequitur:

Step 1: Does the argument contain a conclusion? Yes - The conclusion is that you should sign up for consulting
Step 2: Does the argument present specific premises, evidence, or reasoning? Yes - The premise about WYSIWYG interface limitations
Step 3: Is the evidence or reason relevant to the conclusion? No - The specific technical limitation doesn't logically support the broad consulting conclusion

Pattern: Y/Y/N matches ground truth: Y/Y/N ✓
Both fallacies match! However, Red Herring seems more precisely applicable as it captures the deliberate diversion aspect better than Non Sequitur's focus on irrelevant premises.

LLM:
#classification: False Dilemma#
For False Dilemma:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement presents only two possible outcomes: either you're a witch or you're not a witch
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument uses "either/or" language that suggests only these specific choices exist (witch or not witch, with corresponding punishments)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement excludes other possibilities like the test being invalid or there being other outcomes
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - There are additional reasonable alternatives beyond the two presented, such as the test being flawed or inconclusive
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The statement forces a choice between the limited options while ignoring other legitimate possibilities like questioning the validity of the test itself

Ken: Did you know that in 1828 the dictionary definition of marriage included, “for securing the maintenance and education of children”?  Does that mean that all married couples who can’t or choose not to have children aren’t really married? Paul: No, it just means they need to buy updated dictionaries. Ken: As do you.  The current Merriam-Webster Dictionary includes as a secondary definition, “the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage.

Example:
Cult leaders appear to have a magical level of influence over their followers. They can do no wrong, and anything they say must be true. This mindset is enforced by rewards and punishments related to loyalty. When Jim Jones claimed that hostile forces would convert captured children of the cult to fascism, no fact-checking was involved. Out of loyalty to the leader, Jones’ followers reasoned that suicide was a better alternative and “drank the Kool-Aid” (Flavor Aid). Nine hundred and nine inhabitants of Jonestown died of apparent cyanide poisoning. Three hundred and four of them were children.

LLM:
#classification: Appeal to Loyalty#
For Appeal to Loyalty:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a relationship of loyalty between Jim Jones (cult leader) and his followers

Example:
Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.

#classification: Argument of the Beard#
For Argument of the Beard:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument involves two contrasting extremes (21 years old vs 18 years old for drinking age)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument concludes there's no meaningful difference because there's no definable boundary where exactly someone becomes mature enough to drink
Step 3 evaluation: No - No additional evidence is supplied to support the conclusion beyond the lack of a clear boundary

Example:
So you are saying your car is worth $20k.  I think it is worth $1, so let’s just compromise and say it is worth $10k. (Assuming the car is worth $20k)

LLM:
#classification: Argument to Moderation#
For Argument to Moderation:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There are two opposing positions presented: the car is worth $20k vs. the car is worth $1
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - A third position is presented ($10k) that gives moderation between the first two positions
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The third position ($10k compromise) is claimed to be correct only because it is a compromise between the other two positions, despite the assumption that the car is actually worth $20k

Example:
Mike: Did you know that the author of the book, “Logically Fallacious,” made a fortune on the Internet? Jon: So? Mike: That means that this book must be awesome!

LLM:
#classification: Genetic Fallacy#
For Genetic Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is evaluating the claim that the book is awesome (its truth value)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument focuses on the origin/source of the claim (the author made a fortune on the Internet)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion about the book being awesome is based solely on information about the author's financial success
Step 4 evaluation: No - The author's financial success from the Internet is not relevant to determining whether the book is actually awesome
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The argument follows the pattern: 'This book comes from [successful author], therefore it is awesome'

Example:
Daryl: Answer honestly, do you think if we were born and raised in Iran, by Iranian parents, we would still be Christian, or would we be Muslim? Ross: I think those of us raised in a place where Christianity is taught are fortunate. Daryl:  I agree, but do you think if we were born and raised in Iran, by Iranian parents, we would still be Christian, or would we be Muslim? Ross: Your faith is weak -- you need to pray to God to make it stronger. Daryl:  I guess you’re right.  What was I thinking?

LLM:
#classification: Ad Hominem Circumstantial#
For Ad Hominem Circumstantial:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There are two opposing positions with Daryl questioning faith origins and Ross defending Christianity
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Daryl is making an argument about how birthplace affects religious belief
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Ross attacks Daryl's circumstances (weak faith) rather than addressing the argument about geographic influence on belief
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Ross suggests Daryl's circumstances (weak faith) predispose him to his questioning position
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Ross concludes Daryl's argument is invalid solely because of his weak faith circumstances, not the merit of the argument

Example:
Only 6% of applicants make it into this school, but my son is brilliant!  They are certainly going to accept him!

LLM:
#classification: Base Rate Fallacy#
For Base Rate Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Statistical information is available (6% acceptance rate)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statistical information is ignored in favor of personal assessment
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Irrelevant information (son being "brilliant") is used to make the judgment instead of considering the base rate

Example:
Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.

LLM:
#classification: Begging the Question#
For Begging the Question:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A person is making a claim that paranormal activity is real
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument's validity depends on already accepting what it's trying to prove (that paranormal activity exists)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The claim uses circular reasoning by using the conclusion (paranormal activity is real) as the premise (I experienced paranormal activity)

Example:
Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each.  Therefore, Americans are very wealthy.

LLM:
#classification: Biased Sample Fallacy#
For Biased Sample Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A population (American homeowners) is being sampled with 1000 respondents
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The sampled population is being used to draw conclusions about a larger population (all Americans)
Step 3 evaluation: No - The sample population was not carefully chosen to be representative of the larger population (homeowners are not representative of all Americans)
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion contains a possible bias in the sample that does not exist in the larger population (homeowners are likely wealthier than the general American population)

Example:
During the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg after World War II,  Nazi war criminals were charged with genocide, mass murder, torture, and other atrocities.  Their defense: "I was only following orders".

LLM:
#classification: Appeal to Force#
For Appeal to Force:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains an implicit threat (punishment for not following orders)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The threat was directed at the person being asked to accept the conclusion (the defendants)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The threat was intended to coerce agreement (following orders to avoid consequences)
Step 4 evaluation: No - There is no additional logical reasoning or evidence supplemented beyond the coercion
