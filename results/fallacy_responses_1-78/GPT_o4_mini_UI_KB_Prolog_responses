-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
In the movie, My Cousin Vinny, Ralph Maccio's character, Bill, was interrogated for suspected murder. When the police officer asks him, "At what point did you shoot the clerk?" Bill replies in shock, "I shot the clerk? I shot the clerk?" Later in the film, the police officer reads Bill's statement as a confession in court, "...and he said, 'I shot the clerk. I shot the clerk.'"

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Internal Processing)
After systematically applying every fallacy’s diagnostic questions to the My Cousin Vinny exchange, the only fallacy whose entire instruction set matches perfectly is Accent Fallacy.

Accent Fallacy

Is there an original claim or statement being made?

Yes. Bill, in shock, repeats “I shot the clerk?” as a question.

Is there an emphasis or accent placed in the original statement?

Yes. Bill’s original emphasis is on the speaker’s incredulity (“I shot the clerk?”) 

Is the statement being reinterpreted with the emphasis on a different word or phrase?

Yes. In court it’s read as a flat assertion (“I shot the clerk.”), shifting emphasis off the subject’s shock to an admission of guilt. 

Does this shift in accent change the meaning of the statement?

Yes. What was originally a surprised denial is recast as a confession. 

All four “yes” answers match the ground truth for Accent Fallacy (yes ∧ yes ∧ yes ∧ yes), confirming it as our Step 1 candidate.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
According to the Prolog relationships, Accent Fallacy is often confused with:

Contextomy

Complex Question Fallacy 

We now apply each of their full diagnostic routines:

2.1 Contextomy
Steps (ground_truth: [yes, no, yes]) 

Identify if an external source is mentioned or quoted as support for an argument.

Identify if the meaning of the external source out of context is the same as it is in the original context.

Identify if the argument relies on the out-of-context evidence as support.

Application to the scene:

External source quoted? Yes: Bill’s own words are quoted in court.

Meaning out of context same as original? No: The courtroom reading strips away Bill’s incredulity.

Argument relies on out-of-context evidence? Yes: The court treats the question as a straightforward confession.

This yields [yes ∧ no ∧ yes], which fails the “all yes” pattern (step 2 mismatches), so Contextomy does not apply here.

2.2 Complex Question Fallacy
Steps (ground_truth: [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]) 

Identify if there is a question being asked.

Identify if the question contains built-in assumptions.

Identify if the assumptions are misleading.

Does the question hide a claim to protect the asker from direct accusations?

Identify if answering the question would implicitly accept the embedded assumptions.

Application to the scene:

Is there a question? Yes: “At what point did you shoot the clerk?”

Built-in assumptions? Yes: It presumes Bill did shoot the clerk.

Assumptions misleading? Yes: Bill had not shot anyone.

Hides a claim? Yes: It covertly asserts guilt while phrasing it as inquiry.

Answering implies acceptance? Yes: Any answer admits the act.

This yields [yes ∧ yes ∧ yes ∧ yes ∧ yes], matching the ground truth ⇒ Complex Question Fallacy could also describe the police officer’s question.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Fallacy	Accent	Contextomy	Complex Question
All diagnostic steps affirmative?	✔️	❌	✔️
Involves misinterpretation by emphasis?	✔️	–	–
Involves hidden presupposition?	–	–	✔️

Contextomy fails one of its required steps.

Complex Question Fallacy fits the interrogation perfectly, but it describes only the officer’s question, not the subsequent courtroom misquotation.

Accent Fallacy uniquely explains both the original emphasis in Bill’s shocked question and the later re-accentuation as a confession.

Conclusion:
The best single classification is Accent Fallacy, because the core issue is the shift in emphasis that changes the meaning of Bill’s words from a question of denial into an apparent confession.

Example: 
I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can never be a surgeon.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Statement: “I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can never be a surgeon.”

Fallacy Identified: Accident Fallacy

Reasoning (applying steps from final_instructions.json):

Is there a general rule or principle being stated?

Yes: “One should never deliberately hurt another person.” 

Is that rule being applied universally without consideration of exceptions?

Yes: The speaker applies it to all contexts, including medical practice. 

Are there legitimate exceptions to the rule that should be considered?

Yes: Medical interventions like surgery deliberately hurt (incisions) but aim to heal. 

Does the argument ignore or dismiss these exceptions to maintain the rule’s absolute application?

Yes: The speaker disregards the healing purpose of surgical harm. 

Does the conclusion treat the general rule as having no exceptions whatsoever?

Yes: Concludes one “can never be a surgeon” under any circumstances. 

All diagnostic answers align with the ground_truth ["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"] under “Accident Fallacy” 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
Using prolog.pro, we find which fallacies are often confused with Accident Fallacy:

scss
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(accident_fallacy, equivocation).
often_confused_with(equivocation, accident_fallacy).


Related Fallacy: Equivocation

Analysis applying steps for “Equivocation” (from final_instructions.json):

Do key terms appear multiple times in the statement?

Yes: the word “hurt” appears in both clauses.

Are multiple meanings of the same key term used?

No: “hurt” consistently means physical harm, not a second sense.

Does the statement rely on misinterpreting an ambiguous term to mislead?

No: there is no shift in meaning.

These answers (yes, no, no) do not match the ground_truth ["yes","yes","yes"] for Equivocation 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Candidate Results:

Accident Fallacy: Perfect match with every ground_truth step.

Equivocation: Fails to meet key steps 2 & 3.

Selection: Accident Fallacy

Comprehensive Reasoning:
The argument rests on a universal moral rule without recognizing context-specific exceptions (surgery’s therapeutic harm). This exactly fits the Accident Fallacy pattern: misapplying a general principle to cases where exceptions legitimately apply. No other fallacy (including the often-confused Equivocation) aligns as cleanly with all diagnostic criteria.

Example: 
Rick: I had a dream last night that I won the lottery!  I have $1000 saved up, so I am buying 1000 tickets! Vici: You know, dreams are not accurate ways to predict the future; they are simply the result of random neurons firing. Rick: The last time I checked, you are no neurologist or psychologist, so how sure are you that I am not seeing the future? Vici: It’s possible you can be seeing the future, I guess.

LLM Response:
Let's begin the fallacy analysis using the structured instructions from final_instructions.json and relationships from prolog.pro.

🔎 STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Statement to classify:

Rick: I had a dream last night that I won the lottery! I have $1000 saved up, so I am buying 1000 tickets!
Vici: You know, dreams are not accurate ways to predict the future; they are simply the result of random neurons firing.
Rick: The last time I checked, you are no neurologist or psychologist, so how sure are you that I am not seeing the future?
Vici: It’s possible you can be seeing the future, I guess.

After silent evaluation and checking all structured fallacies, the best match is:

🎯 Fallacy: Ad Fidentia
Step-by-step execution:

Is there an argument or claim being made by a person?
✔️ Yes — Vici claims that dreams are not predictors of the future.

Does the response address the actual argument/evidence presented?
❌ No — Rick does not address Vici's reasoning; instead, he questions her qualifications.

Does the response question or attack the person's confidence?
✔️ Yes — Rick implies that Vici’s opinion is invalid because she lacks expert credentials.

Is that conclusion drawn based on the person's perceived lack of confidence rather than on the merits of the argument?
✔️ Yes — He implies her conclusion is untrustworthy because she’s not a neurologist or psychologist.

✅ Match with Ground Truth: ["yes", "no", "yes", "yes"] — Perfect match.

🔄 STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, Ad Fidentia is often confused with:

appeal_to_false_authority

appeal_to_possibility

1. 🔍 Fallacy: Appeal to False Authority
Steps:

Does the argument cite a person or source as an authority?
✔️ Yes – Rick suggests that Vici is not a neurologist, implying the need for authority.

Is the authority actually qualified in the relevant field?
❌ No – Vici is not cited as an authority, but Rick critiques her lack of credentials.

Does the argument rely on irrelevant authority to add credibility to the claim?
✔️ Yes – Rick implies that Vici's argument is invalid due to lack of credentials.

✅ Result: ["yes", "no", "yes"] → Perfect match.

2. 🔍 Fallacy: Appeal to Possibility
Steps:

Does the argument present something as possible?
✔️ Yes — Vici concedes, "It’s possible you can be seeing the future."

Does the conclusion treat this possibility as if it were true or probably true?
✔️ Yes — Rick treats the dream as predictive and acts on it by buying 1000 tickets.

Is there sufficient evidence to support the leap from 'possible' to 'true/probable'?
❌ No — No evidence is presented beyond the dream.

✅ Result: ["yes", "yes", "no"] → Perfect match.

✅ STEP 3: Final Selection and Reasoning
Candidates and Comparison:
Fallacy	Match?	Core Mechanism
Ad Fidentia	✅	Undermines Vici’s claim by questioning her qualifications, not her argument
Appeal to False Authority	✅	Involves invalid credential-based reasoning
Appeal to Possibility	✅	Uses mere possibility as a reason for belief in a dream prediction

✅ Final Selection: Ad Fidentia
Reasoning:

It directly explains Rick’s tactic of undermining Vici’s confidence and authority, rather than engaging with her claim.

The other two fallacies are related but secondary: they explain why his reasoning is flawed but not how he strategically avoids confronting her logic.

The ground truth match for Ad Fidentia is perfect, and it centers on confidence-based invalidation, which is the crux of Rick’s reply.

Would you like a structured output report or should I continue to the next example?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Frieda: I just know that Raymond is just waiting to ask me out. Edna: He has been seeing Rose for three months now. Frieda: He is just seeing her to make me jealous. Edna: They’re engaged. Frieda: Well, that’s just his way of making sure I know about it.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification
Frieda repeatedly attributes Raymond’s actions to hidden motives (“just waiting to ask me out,” “just seeing her to make me jealous,” “that’s just his way of making sure I know about it”) without any supporting evidence or evaluation of those actions on their own merits. This perfectly fits the Psychogenetic Fallacy, whose defining pattern is:

Someone makes a claim or performs an action.

A psychological motive is attributed (“to make me jealous,” “to make sure I know”).

The claim/action is dismissed or reinterpreted solely on the basis of that motive, with no examination of its inherent validity or evidence.

No substantive reasoning is provided for the original claim or action. 

Step 2: Related/Confused Fallacies
According to the Prolog relationships, the Psychogenetic Fallacy is often confused with:

Genetic Fallacy

Insignificant Cause

Gish-Gallop

Spotlight Fallacy

Stereotyping the Fallacy

Begging the Question 

A brief check of each against Frieda’s statements shows:

Genetic Fallacy (rejecting a claim because of its origin): Frieda isn’t dismissing Rose or their relationship because of where it came from.

Insignificant Cause (treating a minor factor as the sole cause): Frieda isn’t arguing that one small factor alone caused the entire situation.

Gish-Gallop (overwhelming with many weak arguments): There is no rapid-fire barrage of separate points.

Spotlight Fallacy (treating an isolated example as if it were representative): Not applicable—Frieda isn’t generalizing a group from a single example.

Stereotyping the Fallacy (attributing characteristics to an individual based on group membership): Not present.

Begging the Question (circular reasoning): Frieda’s premises don’t assume her conclusion in advance.

None of these come close to matching as precisely as the Psychogenetic Fallacy.

Step 3: Final Selection
On balance, Psychogenetic Fallacy is the only fallacy whose step-by-step criteria all map directly onto Frieda’s pattern of attributing unverified motives and using them as the sole basis to reinterpret or dismiss Raymond’s actions 
.

Conclusion:
Frieda’s reasoning is a Psychogenetic Fallacy—she dismisses and reinterprets Raymond’s actions exclusively by guessing his psychological motives, without any direct evidence or logical evaluation of his actual behavior.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Using the instructions for Ad Hominem Abusive from final_instructions.json (which require five “yes” answers) we apply them to the statement:

“My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea – this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!”

Argument/claim (Y) by person X?
Yes – the opponent’s claim is “lowering taxes will be a good idea.”

Personal attack (Z) on person X?
Yes – “a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night” attacks her personally.

Attack irrelevant to argument’s validity?
Yes – eating ice cream has no bearing on tax policy.

Attack used to reject/discredit the original argument?
Yes – the speaker implies the tax argument is bad solely because of her eating habit.

Pattern: “X claims Y; X has trait Z; therefore Y is false”?
Yes – the conclusion (“lowering taxes is a bad idea”) is tied only to the personal trait.

All five steps match the ground truth of ["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"] 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, the fallacies often confused with Ad Hominem Abusive are:

Appeal to the Law

Extended Analogy

Fact–to–Fiction Fallacy

Fallacy of Opposition

Argument from Fallacy

Proof Surrogate 

For each, a brief check:

Appeal to the Law

Steps: Does the argument equate legality with morality?

Result: Not applicable (no reference to laws).

Extended Analogy

Steps: Are two unlike things compared as if equivalent?

Result: Not present.

Fact–to–Fiction Fallacy

Steps: Is a factual claim dismissed as nonsense?

Result: No.

Fallacy of Opposition

Steps: Is a view dismissed simply because it opposes yours?

Result: No – the opponent’s view isn’t rejected for mere opposition, but via personal attack.

Argument from Fallacy

Steps: Is the argument deemed false solely because it contains a fallacy?

Result: Here the speaker implies the claim is false based on a personal trait, not because the claim itself has a logical error.

Proof Surrogate

Steps: Is something like “experts agree” used without evidence?

Result: No.

None of these related fallacies fit as well as Ad Hominem Abusive, which perfectly matches every step of its instruction set.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Selection: Ad Hominem Abusive

Reasoning:

It directly targets the person’s irrelevant personal habit rather than addressing the merits of the tax argument.

Every diagnostic step for Ad Hominem Abusive is affirmed, while all related/confused fallacies fail one or more of their critical steps.

This yields the strongest match both logically and procedurally.

Therefore, the statement is best classified as an Ad Hominem Abusive fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Salesman: This car gets better than average gas mileage and is one of the most reliable cars according to Consumer Reports. Will: I doubt it—you obviously just want to sell me that car.

LLM Response:
STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
I applied the “Ad Hominem Circumstantial” checklist from final_instructions.json to Will’s response (“I doubt it—you obviously just want to sell me that car.”):

Two parties (Salesman vs. Will)? → Yes

Person 1 makes a claim (“This car gets better than average gas mileage…”)? → Yes

Person 2 attacks Person 1’s circumstances or vested interest (Will accuses the salesman of self-interest rather than addressing the evidence)? → Yes

Attack implies predisposition due to those circumstances (“…you just want to sell me that car”)? → Yes

Conclusion rejects the claim solely because of those circumstances (Will doesn’t engage the mileage/reliability claim itself)? → Yes

All five answers match the ground truth of ["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"] for Ad Hominem Circumstantial 
.

STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, “Ad Hominem Circumstantial” is often_confused_with Bulverism 
.

I then ran the Bulverism checklist against the statement:

Two parties? → Yes

Does Respondent assume the argument is wrong based on solid logic? → No (Will does not engage the factual claim)

Does Respondent dismiss the argument based on the arguer’s motives? → Yes

This matches Bulverism’s ground truth of ["yes","no","yes"] 
.

STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both Ad Hominem Circumstantial and Bulverism fit perfectly:

Ad Hominem Circumstantial focuses on dismissing an argument because of the speaker’s vested interest.

Bulverism focuses on assuming an argument is false solely because of the speaker’s motives.

Here, Will does exactly that—he never addresses the mileage/reliability evidence, but jumps straight to “you want to sell me that car,” thus both attacking the circumstance and assuming the claim is false because of it.

However, Bulverism is the more precise classification: it captures the pattern of presuming a claim false based on motive, rather than simply attacking the circumstance. Therefore, the best fit is:

Bulverism
“Dismissing an argument by presuming it false owing to the arguer’s motives, without engaging the argument itself.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work.  This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support.  Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically.

LLM Response:
Final Classification: Ad Hominem Abusive

Comprehensive Reasoning:

Match with “Ad Hominem Abusive” Ground Truth

Argument/claim (Y) by person (Delores): She supports “equal pay for equal work.”

Personal attack (Z) against Delores: she’s labeled an “extremist” akin to “extreme feminist groups.”

Irrelevance of the attack to the argument’s validity: Delores’s political stance on pay equity isn’t logically undermined by her alleged extremism.

Attack used to discredit the argument: “Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously … politically.” directly rejects her policy position on the basis of personal vilification.

Pattern conformity (“X claims Y; X has trait Z; therefore Y is false”):

“Delores (X) claims equal pay policy (Y). Delores is an extremist (Z). Therefore, the policy isn’t serious.” 

All five diagnostic questions for Ad Hominem Abusive are answered “yes,” matching its ground truth exactly 
.

Analysis of Related/Frequently-Confused Fallacies
According to prolog.txt, “Ad Hominem Abusive” is often confused with several other fallacies. Below is a brief examination of the most relevant ones and why they do not fit the statement as well:

Ad Hominem Guilt by Association:

Pattern: “X associates with Y (a bad group); therefore X is bad.”

Why it doesn’t fit: The argument isn’t merely pointing out Delores’s association; it directly attacks her character (“extremist”) to dismiss her argument. 

Appeal to the Law:

Pattern: “Because something is legal/illegal, it is moral/immoral.”

Why it doesn’t fit: There is no reference to legality or moral authority conferred by law. 

Argument from Fallacy:

Pattern: “Because the argument contains a fallacy, the conclusion is false.”

Why it doesn’t fit: The statement doesn’t critique Delores’s argument as fallacious; it simply dismisses her based on her character. 

Extended Analogy & Fact-to-Fiction Fallacy:

These involve misusing analogies or conflating hypothetical (“fiction”) with factual claims. No analogies or hypothetical scenarios are used here. 

Fallacy of Opposition:

Pattern: “If someone opposes me, they must be wrong.”

Why it doesn’t fit: The dismissal is personal (“extremist”), not simply because she opposes the speaker. 

Across all these, none exhibit the complete set of characteristics present in the user’s statement—where a personal attack replaces substantive engagement with the policy argument.

Why “Ad Hominem Abusive” Is the Best Fit

It directly targets Delores’s persona (“extremist”) as the reason to reject her take on pay equity.

It follows the canonical structure:

Person X asserts policy Y. Person X has negative trait Z. Therefore, policy Y is invalid.

No other similar fallacy captures both the personal nature of the attack and its deployment as the sole ground for dismissal.

Conclusion: The statement is a textbook case of Ad Hominem Abusive, since it leverages a derogatory label (“extremist”) to discredit Delores’s argument rather than addressing the merits of equal-pay policy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Helga: You should not be eating that... it has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health. Hugh: You eat fat burgers all the time so that can’t be true.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification and Analysis
The dialogue is:

Helga: “You should not be eating that… it has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health.”
Hugh: “You eat fat burgers all the time so that can’t be true.”

Hugh’s reply dismisses Helga’s evidence-based claim solely because Helga herself eats fat burgers—a classic Ad Hominem Tu Quoque (you-too) fallacy, where one rejects an argument by accusing the speaker of hypocrisy rather than addressing the argument’s merits.

Step-by-step per JSON instructions for Ad Hominem Tu Quoque 
:

Are there two parties—one making a claim and another responding? Yes.

Does the respondent point out an inconsistency between the claimant’s argument and their actions? Yes.

Does the respondent conclude the argument is false based solely on this inconsistency? Yes.

All three conditions match the ground truth (“yes, yes, yes”) for Ad Hominem Tu Quoque.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Secondary Analyses
From the Prolog relationships, Ad Hominem Tu Quoque is often confused with:

Double Standard

Retrogressive Causation 

We perform the same JSON-driven analysis for each.

2a. Double Standard
JSON Steps & Ground Truth 
:

Identify if there are two or more similar situations being compared.

Are both situations similar enough to be judged by the same standard?

Are the same standards applied to judge both situations?

Is any different standard used to support the respondent’s position?
→ Ground truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “no”, “yes”]

Application to Hugh’s Reply:

Helga’s claim (fat burgers are unhealthy) vs. Helga’s own eating behavior—two “situations.” → Yes.

Both concern eating fat burgers. → Yes.

Does Hugh apply exactly the same standard? No—he ignores Helga’s evidence while highlighting her behavior. → No.

He uses Helga’s personal practice to dismiss the general rule. → Yes.

This matches ground truth (“yes, yes, no, yes”), confirming Double Standard also applies superficially—but notice step 3 (“Are the same standards applied?”) fails, indicating a misapplication of standard.

2b. Retrogressive Causation
JSON Steps & Ground Truth 
:

Is there a claimed causal relationship where X causes Y?

Is Y presented as a problem needing elimination?

Does the proposed solution involve doing more of X?

Does this logic use the cause to solve its own effect?

Is the source of the problem used as its own remedy?
→ Ground truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “yes”, “yes”, “yes”]

Application to Hugh’s Reply:

There is no suggestion that eating more fat burgers cures anything; rather, Hugh simply points to Helga’s hypocrisy. Steps 3–5 are not met.

Thus Retrogressive Causation does not fit.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Comparing all analyses:

Fallacy	Matches All Steps?	Notes
Ad Hominem Tu Quoque	Yes	Perfect alignment with all three JSON criteria.
Double Standard	No	Fails step 3 (applies inconsistent standards).
Retrogressive Causation	No	Irrelevant—no causal‐remedy loop present.

Conclusion:
Ad Hominem Tu Quoque is the best fit. Hugh’s objection rejects Helga’s health-based argument by attacking her character (her own eating habits) instead of addressing the scientific evidence about fat burgers. This precisely matches the fallacy’s definition and ground truths.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
No people under the age of 66 are senior citizens. No senior citizens are children. Therefore, all people under the age of 66 are children.

LLM Response:
STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Identified Fallacy: Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise
From final_instructions.json:

Is the argument structured as a categorical syllogism?

Yes: “No people under 66 are senior citizens. No senior citizens are children. Therefore, all people under 66 are children.” 

Does at least one of the premises contain a negative statement?

Yes: Both premises are negative (“No … are …”). 

Is the conclusion an affirmative statement?

Yes: The conclusion affirms “all people under 66 are children.” 

Is there a valid logical path from the negative premise to the affirmative conclusion?

No: Negative premises cannot yield an affirmative conclusion in valid categorical logic. 

All answers match the ground truths except the last, which correctly fails.

STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, we see this often confused relationship:

scss
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(affirmative_conclusion_from_a_negative_premise, exclusive_premises).


Related/Confused Fallacy: Exclusive Premises

Revisiting final_instructions.json for “Exclusive Premises”:

Is there a categorical syllogism?

Yes: same structure as above. 

Are there exactly two premises that are negative statements?

Yes: “No … are …” and “No … are …”. 

Does the first premise use ‘No X are Y’ or ‘Some X are not Y’?

Yes: “No people under 66 are senior citizens.” 

Does the second premise use ‘Some Y are not Z’ or ‘No Y are Z’?

Yes: “No senior citizens are children.” 

Is a conclusion reached about the relationship between X and Z?

Yes: “All people under 66 are children.” 

All steps align perfectly with the ground truths for Exclusive Premises.

STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise matched 3 of 4 steps but correctly failed the final validity check.

Exclusive Premises matched all 5 diagnostic steps exactly.

Both analyses are logically consistent, but Exclusive Premises provides the most precise description (two negative premises leading to an invalid conclusion).

Final Classification:

Exclusive Premises — the categorical syllogism commits the fallacy of having two negative premises, rendering any affirmative conclusion invalid.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
I can’t stop eating these chocolates.  I really love chocolate, or I seriously lack willpower.  I know I really love chocolate; therefore, I cannot lack willpower.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Identify the Primary Fallacy (Affirming a Disjunct)

The statement presents a disjunction:

“I really love chocolate, or I seriously lack willpower.”
This is of the form “P or Q.”

It then affirms one disjunct as true (P):

“I know I really love chocolate…”

And rejects the other disjunct (Q) solely because the first is true:

“…therefore, I cannot lack willpower.”

This exactly matches the pattern for Affirming a Disjunct, where one concludes “not Q” from “P” in “P or Q.”

Checking against the canonical steps and ground truth for Affirming a Disjunct:

Disjunction present? Yes.

One disjunct affirmed? Yes.

Other disjunct claimed false? Yes.

Falsehood inferred solely from the first? Yes.

Is ‘or’ defined as exclusive? No (colloquially “or” is inclusive)

Does it follow the exact logical pattern? Yes.

This is a textbook case of Affirming a Disjunct 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacies Often Confused with It
Querying the Prolog relationships yields two fallacies most often confused with Affirming a Disjunct:

False Dilemma

Cherry-Picking

From the Prolog file:

often_confused_with(affirming_a_disjunct, false_dilemma)
often_confused_with(affirming_a_disjunct, cherry_picking)

Step 3: Analyze Each Related Fallacy

False Dilemma (“False Dichotomy”)

Definition: Presents only two exhaustive options when others exist.

Checklist:

Are only two options presented? Yes.

Are other viable alternatives ignored? Here, the speaker ignores possibilities like “I have moderate willpower but sometimes overindulge.”

Is the argument based solely on those two? Yes.

Ground Truth for False Dilemma: steps [“yes”, “yes”, “yes”], but here our statement relies on the inclusive “or,” not on forcing an exclusive either-or of all possibilities.

Conclusion: Though it superficially looks like a false dilemma, the core mistake is not excluding other willpower explanations but rather inferring “not Q” from “P” in an inclusive disjunction. Therefore, False Dilemma is not the best fit.

Cherry-Picking

Definition: Selectively presents only evidence that supports one side, omitting contradictory data.

Checklist:

Does the speaker omit legitimate evidence? Not really—the issue isn’t evidence selection, but misuse of the disjunction.

Is the omission purposeful? No indication of deliberate suppression of counter-evidence.

Conclusion: The argument isn’t about selective evidence, so Cherry-Picking does not apply.

Step 4: Final Selection & Reasoning

Affirming a Disjunct fits perfectly: the speaker infers the falsity of one disjunct solely because the other is true.

False Dilemma and Cherry-Picking lack the precise logical structure exhibited.

Therefore, the best and most precise classification is:

Affirming a Disjunct
This matches the ground-truth pattern and the logical form exhibited in the statement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
If taxes are lowered, I will have more money to spend. I have more money to spend. Therefore, taxes must have been lowered.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We apply the “Affirming the Consequent” instruction set from final_instructions.json to the statement:

If taxes are lowered, I will have more money to spend.
I have more money to spend.
Therefore, taxes must have been lowered.

Step 1: Is there a conditional statement (“If P then Q”)?
Answer: Yes.

Step 2: Is the consequent (Q) stated as true?
Answer: Yes.

Step 3: Does the reasoning flow from Q being true to P being true?
Answer: Yes.

These match the ground truths for “Affirming the Consequent” (yes, yes, yes). 

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.txt, we find the fallacies often confused with affirming_the_consequent:

prejudicial_language 

commutation_of_conditionals 

Prejudicial Language
Instruction set 

Does the statement make a claim or proposition? Yes.

Does it use loaded/emotive terms? No.

Are such terms used to manipulate judgment? No.

… (remaining steps also fail).
➔ Does not match the all-“yes” ground truths for this fallacy.

Commutation of Conditionals
Instruction set 

Is a statement being made? Yes.

Does it contain a conditional “If P then Q”? Yes.

Is the antecedent and consequent switched?
Here, the argument treats “If I have more money then taxes were lowered.” → Yes.

Is that switched conditional assumed true? Yes.

Is “If Q then P” logically correct? No.
➔ Matches the ground truths (yes, yes, yes, yes, no).

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both “Affirming the Consequent” and “Commutation of Conditionals” perfectly match their respective instruction sets and ground truths. However:

Affirming the Consequent is the standard name for this mis-reasoning pattern (“If P then Q; Q; therefore P”).

Commutation of Conditionals describes the same logical error in technical terms (switching antecedent and consequent), but is less commonly used.

Conclusion:
The statement best exemplifies the Affirming the Consequent fallacy, as it directly follows that pattern and is the conventional label for this error.

Example: 
People everywhere recognize the need to help the starving children of the world.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Primary Candidate)
Fallacy Name: Appeal to Common Belief
Instruction Steps & Internal Answers:

Does the argument claim that many/most people believe something?

Answer: Yes. The statement asserts “People everywhere recognize…” 

Is this popular belief presented as evidence for the truth of the claim?

Answer: Yes. It uses the fact that “people everywhere” believe the need exists as support. 

Does the argument have independent evidence beyond the appeal to numbers?

Answer: No. No other facts or data are offered—only the popularity itself. 

Does it follow the pattern “Many people believe X, therefore X is true”?

Answer: Yes. That is exactly the structure here. 

All four answers match the ground-truth pattern for Appeal to Common Belief: ["yes","yes","no","yes"] 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
Using the Prolog relationships, we find fallacies often confused with Appeal to Common Belief:

prolog
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(appeal_to_common_belief, appeal_to_popularity).
often_confused_with(appeal_to_popularity, appeal_to_common_belief).
So the only related/confused fallacy is Appeal to Popularity 
.

Analysis for Appeal to Popularity
Instruction Steps & Internal Answers:

Does the argument use popularity as evidence?

Answer: Yes. It leans entirely on how widespread the belief is.

Is popularity the reason the conclusion is accepted?

Answer: Yes. No other reasoning is provided.

Does the argument treat popularity as sufficient justification for truth or correctness?

Answer: Yes. It implies that because “people everywhere” recognize it, it must be true.

These three “yes” responses exactly match its ground-truth pattern ["yes","yes","yes"].

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Fallacy	Steps Matched / Total	Ground-Truth Match	Notes
Appeal to Common Belief	4 / 4	✓	Exact “many believe X, so X is true” form.
Appeal to Popularity	3 / 3	✓	Very similar, but broader—focuses on popularity generally.

Both fallacies fit perfectly, but the statement’s precise wording—“People everywhere recognize…”—directly invokes the notion of common belief rather than simply “popularity.” The JSON for Appeal to Common Belief captures the absence of any independent evidence (step 3), which is a critical nuance here. Therefore, the best classification is:

Final Classification
Appeal to Common Belief

Comprehensive Reasoning:

The statement asserts that “people everywhere” hold a belief, then uses that very belief as its sole justification.

There is no supplementary data or reasoning provided—only the popularity of the belief.

This aligns exactly with the four-step pattern of Appeal to Common Belief and matches its ground-truth answers.

Although closely related to Appeal to Popularity, the explicit reference to “common belief” (and the JSON’s emphasis on independent evidence) makes Appeal to Common Belief the most precise fit.

Example: 
In programming CGI, a WYSIWYG interface doesn't handle PHP or CSS very well. If you sign up for my personal consulting, I will show you how to program effectively.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Analysis of “Appeal to Authority”
The statement—“If you sign up for my personal consulting, I will show you how to program effectively”—relies on the speaker’s (self-proclaimed) expertise as the sole reason to accept their solution. According to the JSON instructions for Appeal to Authority:

Does the argument cite an authority, expert, or credible source?

“my personal consulting” invokes the speaker as an expert. 

Does the argument claim something is true solely because the authority said so?

The only justification offered for “programming effectively” is the speaker’s consulting. 

Is the authority actually qualified in the relevant field?

No credentials are provided to verify the speaker’s expertise in CGI, PHP, or CSS. 

Does it follow the pattern “Expert X says Y, therefore Y is true”?

Yes—the conclusion (“you will program effectively”) rests entirely on “Expert (me) says so.” 

All four steps yield yes, matching the fallacy’s ground truths: [yes, yes, yes, yes].

Step 2: Related Fallacies via Prolog
The Prolog file lists fallacies often confused with Appeal to Authority:

Appeal to False Authority

Appeal to Trust

We apply their full analyses:

Appeal to False Authority

Cites an authority? Yes (“my personal consulting”).

Is the authority directly qualified? No—no credentials are given.

Relies on irrelevant or unqualified authority? Yes.
Ground truths: [yes, no, yes] → matches.

Appeal to Trust

Source referenced? Yes (the speaker/consultant).

Source characterized as trustworthy? Yes (implicitly by offering consulting).

Claim attributed to that source? Yes (“I will show you how…”).

Conclusion based solely on source’s perceived trustworthiness? Yes.
Ground truths: [yes, yes, yes, yes] → matches.

Step 3: Final Selection
All three candidates perfectly satisfy their respective ground truths. However, the core of the argument is that because the speaker is an expert (consultant)—and only that—the audience should accept their promise of effective programming. This aligns most directly with Appeal to Authority, in which an authority’s word substitutes for substantive evidence or reasoning.

Conclusion: The statement commits an Appeal to Authority.
Reasoning: It substitutes the speaker’s authority as the only justification for the claim, without presenting any independent evidence of effectiveness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Max: If you’re not a witch, you have nothing to fear.  If you’re not a witch, you are not made of wood; therefore, you will sink and drown after we tie you up and throw you in the well.  If you do float, then you are made of wood, you are a witch, and we will hang you. Glinda: Wait, how is it I have nothing to worry about if I am not a witch?

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Identified Fallacy: False Dilemma
We applied the five-step rubric for the False Dilemma fallacy to the “witch test” scenario, comparing each result against the JSON’s ground-truths 
:

Limited choices presented?

The statement frames only two outcomes: you either sink or you float.

Result: Yes (matches ground_truth “yes”).

“Either/or” phrasing?

Implicit “if…then” logic functions as an either/or: sink ⇒ not-witch, float ⇒ witch.

Result: Yes (matches ground_truth “yes”).

Excludes other possibilities?

No allowance for any outcome besides the two forced ones (e.g. you could swim, cling to a plank, elude the test).

Result: Yes (matches ground_truth “yes”).

Additional reasonable alternatives exist?

Many—better tests, witnesses, fair trial—are ignored.

Result: Yes (matches ground_truth “yes”).

Forces a choice while ignoring legitimate options?

Both outcomes guarantee condemnation; no fair escape is offered.

Result: Yes (matches ground_truth “yes”).

All five steps returned “yes,” fully matching the ground-truth pattern for False Dilemma 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, False Dilemma is often confused with four other fallacies:

Affirming a Disjunct

Alternative Advance

Suppressed Correlative

McNamara Fallacy

We briefly applied each of their JSON rubrics to the same statement:

2.1 Affirming a Disjunct
Rubric (6 steps; ground_truths: yes, yes, yes, yes, no, yes) 

Disjunctive statement? → Yes

One disjunct affirmed true? → Yes (sink ⇒ not-witch)

Other disjunct claimed false? → Yes (float ⇒ witch ⇒ “not float” as innocent)

Falsity claimed solely because the first is true? → Yes

“Or” exclusive? → No (the test doesn’t define the “or” as strictly exclusive—“float” and “sink” aren’t linguistically marked “exclusive”)

Follows the P/Q ⇒ not-Q/not-P structure? → Yes

Match: Fails at step 5 (ground_truth says “no” but our result is also “no,” so counts as a match). Overall pattern aligns.

2.2 Alternative Advance
Rubric (5 steps; all ground_truths “yes”) 

Only two options presented? → Yes

Both options essentially identical? → No (one leads to drowning, one to hanging—different punishments)

Other alternatives exist? → Yes

Acceptance of limited options? → Yes

Acceptance appears subconscious? → Yes

Match: Fails at step 2. So overall does not fit the rubric.

2.3 Suppressed Correlative
Rubric (5 steps; all ground_truths “yes”) 

Two mutually exclusive categories (witch / not-witch)? → Yes

Originally presented as genuine alternatives? → Yes

One category redefined to absorb the other? → Yes (the “not-witch” case still leads to punishment, effectively collapsing innocence into guilt)

Redefinition makes the distinction meaningless? → Yes

Redefinition renders original term meaningless? → Yes

Match: All five “yes” exactly match.

2.4 McNamara Fallacy
Rubric (3 steps; all ground_truths “yes”) 

Relies exclusively on quantitative data? → Yes (sink/float “test” as binary metric)

Ignores qualitative factors? → Yes (no witness testimony, no rationale)

Decision based solely on hard data? → Yes (sink = innocent, float = guilty)

Match: All three “yes” match.

Step 2 Summary:

Affirming a Disjunct: Matches but is logically a subtype of False Dilemma.

Alternative Advance: Does not match.

Suppressed Correlative: Perfect match with all steps.

McNamara Fallacy: Also perfect match.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Comparing our analyses:

False Dilemma (Initial): perfect five-step match.

Suppressed Correlative: perfect five-step match.

McNamara Fallacy: perfect three-step match.

Affirming a Disjunct: near-perfect match but hinges on exclusivity nuance.

Alternative Advance: rejected.

Between False Dilemma, Suppressed Correlative, and McNamara Fallacy, the strongest conceptual fit is False Dilemma, because:

The argument explicitly forces two negative outcomes (sink versus float) and ignores every other possibility, which is the hallmark of a false dilemma.

Although Suppressed Correlative and McNamara share structural similarities, they emphasize different mis-definitions (redefining categories wholesale or over-reliance on metrics) rather than the core forced-choice tactic.

The “witch test” is classically taught as “false dilemma” (damned if you do, damned if you don’t).

Conclusion: The statement is best classified as the False Dilemma fallacy, because it presents exactly two options—both of which guarantee conviction—while excluding all legitimate alternatives and coercing a choice between them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
The president is a good man and would have never cheated on his wife, and has never cheated in anything in the past.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
I applied the four diagnostic steps for Appeal to Emotion from final_instructions.json to the statement:

“The president is a good man and would have never cheated on his wife, and has never cheated in anything in the past.”

Is a claim being made?
Yes—the speaker asserts the president has never cheated.

Is legitimate evidence or logical reasoning provided?
No—the only “evidence” is an emotional characterization of the president as a “good man.”

Is emotional content used as the primary or sole justification?
Yes—the argument hinges entirely on the president’s goodness.

Is the emotional appeal intended to manipulate acceptance?
Yes—it invites the listener to trust the conclusion because of a positive impression, not facts.

All four match the ground-truth pattern for Appeal to Emotion (yes, no, yes, yes) 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, the following fallacies are often confused with Appeal to Emotion:

Prejudicial Language

Appeal to the Law

Self-Righteousness Fallacy

Wishful Thinking

For each, I ran the same four diagnostic steps:

Related Fallacy	Step 1	Step 2	Step 3	Step 4	Matches Ground Truth?
Prejudicial Language	Claim? → Yes	Evidence? → No	Emotional? → No	Manipulative? → No	✗
Appeal to the Law	Claim? → Yes	Evidence? → No	Emotional? → No	Manipulative? → No	✗
Self-Righteousness	Claim? → Yes	Evidence? → Yes (claims moral purity)	Emotional? → Yes	Manipulative? → Possibly, but evidence is moral argument, not pure emotion	✗
Wishful Thinking	Claim? → Yes	Evidence? → No	Emotional? → Yes	Manipulative? → Yes	✓? (Ground Truth yes,no,yes,yes) but the statement is less about “wishful desire” and more about character ▶ less fitting

Only Wishful Thinking shares the same “yes, no, yes, yes” pattern—but its essence is “assertion accepted because one wants it to be true,” whereas our statement relies on a character-based emotional appeal, not on a desire for a favorable outcome.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Emotion is the only fallacy whose diagnostic steps all align precisely with the structure of the statement.

The related fallacies fail critical steps (e.g., Prejudicial Language and Appeal to the Law do not hinge on emotional manipulation, Self-Righteousness invokes moral evidence, not pure emotion, and Wishful Thinking is about desire rather than character).

Therefore, the best fit is Appeal to Emotion.

Conclusion:
The statement is a clear Appeal to Emotion, using an affective portrayal (“good man”) as the sole basis to conclude the president could not have cheated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe.  Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when.

LLM Response:
Here’s a concise account of the analysis following your three-step procedure, with the internal work summarized and the final classification and reasoning provided.

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
I ran the statement against the “Alleged Certainty” instruction set from final_instructions.json, which specifies these steps and ground truths:

Definitive conclusion asserted?

Statement: “Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when.” → Yes.

Language implying universal knowledge or certainty?

Uses “know exactly” → Yes.

Certainty claim as primary justification?

The argument rests solely on “we know exactly” rather than on evidence → Yes.

Truth value actually uncertain or debatable?

Cosmology is unsettled on precise origin time/mechanism → Yes.

Argument’s strength relies on appearance of certainty?

No substantive support is offered beyond the confident tone → Yes.

All five steps match the “yes” ground truths for Alleged Certainty 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, “Alleged Certainty” is often confused with five other fallacies 
:

Hasty Generalization

Appeal to Emotion

Ambiguity Fallacy

Proof Surrogate

Conflicting Conditions

I ran the same step-by-step tests for each of these, comparing to their JSON ground truths:

Hasty Generalization fails because the statement doesn’t generalize from insufficient examples.

Appeal to Emotion fails step 2: there is no emotional language used to justify the claim.

Ambiguity Fallacy fails: no ambiguous term is being exploited.

Proof Surrogate fails: the statement doesn’t invoke an unspecified source (“Studies show…”) to stand in for real evidence.

Conflicting Conditions fails: the claim contains no internal contradiction of separate premises.

None of these related fallacies fit the statement as precisely as Alleged Certainty does.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Comparing the perfect match of Alleged Certainty against the poor or partial fits of its commonly confused counterparts, it is clear that the speaker’s argument relies entirely on projecting unwarranted certainty—“we know exactly”—rather than on any substantive reasoning or evidence. This aligns exactly with the ground truths for Alleged Certainty and excludes the others.

Final Classification: Alleged Certainty.

Reasoning Summary:

The conclusion is presented with absolute confidence.

No evidence is provided to substantiate the certainty.

Scientific understanding of the universe’s origin remains inherently uncertain in its precise details.

This reliance on mere appearance of certainty is the hallmark of the “Alleged Certainty” fallacy.

Feel free to let me know if you’d like a deeper breakdown of any of the internal step-by-step analyses!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
You know, they say that if you swallow gum it takes seven years to digest.  So whatever you do, don’t swallow the gum!

LLM Response:
The statement “You know, they say that if you swallow gum it takes seven years to digest. So whatever you do, don’t swallow the gum!” most directly commits the Anonymous Authority fallacy. Here’s why:

Analysis as Anonymous Authority

Claim made?
Yes. (“If you swallow gum it takes seven years to digest.”)

Unspecified or vague source?
Yes. (“They say…” points to an unnamed group.)

Indicator of unverifiable source?
Yes. Phrases like “they say” signal the speaker is relying on hearsay rather than concrete evidence.

Source verifiable?
No. The “they” cannot be pinpointed or checked.

Conclusion rests on that source?
Yes. The warning against swallowing gum hinges solely on what “they say.”

All of these line up perfectly with the ground-truth pattern for Anonymous Authority.

Related Fallacy: Argument from Hearsay
In our Prolog file, Anonymous Authority is often confused with Argument from Hearsay. Running the same step-by-step against the statement shows a perfect match there, too:

A testimony is offered (“they say…”): yes

The source cannot be verified as an eyewitness: no

The information has passed through intermediaries: yes

The argument relies on second-hand testimony: yes

Why Anonymous Authority over Hearsay?

Both analyses match their respective ground truths exactly.

Anonymous Authority pinpoints the specific misuse of an unnamed “they” to lend credibility.

Argument from Hearsay covers second-hand reporting generally—but the key flaw here is the appeal to an unnamed authority, not merely that it’s second-hand.

Final Selection:
Anonymous Authority is the best fit because the speaker’s entire case rests on “they say,” an unverifiable, unnamed authority, rather than on any actual digestive science or evidence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Akoni: The Polynesian fire goddess, Pele, sacrificed her own daughter in the volcano to bring peace to the islands. This is how I know she loves us. Ubon: Aren't the gods and goddesses immortal? Akoni: Err, yes. Ubon: Then what happened to Pele's daughter after she was thrown in the volcano? Akoni: She was reunited with Pele in the heavens. Ubon: So why was this a sacrifice?

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Fallacy under consideration: Conflicting Conditions

Step 1.1: Identify if a claim is being made.

Finding: Yes. Akoni asserts that Pele sacrificed her daughter to bring peace.

Step 1.2: Identify if one part of the claim contradicts another part.

Finding: Yes. Pele is described as immortal, yet her daughter is said to have been killed in a volcano.

Step 1.3: Identify if the contradiction makes the entire claim logically impossible.

Finding: Yes. If gods are immortal, they cannot die (nor sacrifice someone irretrievably), so the notion of a genuine “sacrifice” is incoherent.

All three steps align with the ground truths for Conflicting Conditions 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, Conflicting Conditions is often confused with:

Anthropomorphism 

Alternative Advance 

Inconsistency 

Alleged Certainty 

We apply each fallacy’s JSON-defined steps in turn:

2.1 Anthropomorphism
Step: Is there a claim that depends on non-human entities (gods) being described with human traits?

Finding: Yes—the argument treats Pele (a goddess) as capable of human actions (sacrifice).

Ground truth: yes 

Result: Matches ground truth.

2.2 Alternative Advance
Step 2.2.1: Are only two options presented?

Finding: No—Akoni doesn’t limit the story to two identical alternatives.

Ground truth: yes 

Result: Does not match ground truth.

2.3 Inconsistency
Step 2.3.1: Does the statement assert two distinct propositions?

Finding: Yes—Pele is immortal; her daughter died.

Step 2.3.2: Are those propositions logically incompatible?

Finding: Yes—immortality precludes death.

Step 2.3.3: Are both presented as true?

Finding: Yes—both claims are asserted without qualification.

Step 2.3.4: Is the inconsistency intentional?

Finding: No—it appears unintended.

Ground truths: [yes, yes, yes, no] 

Result: Fully matches ground truths.

2.4 Alleged Certainty
Step 2.4.1: Is a definitive conclusion asserted?

Finding: Yes—“This is how I know she loves us.”

Step 2.4.2: Does the statement use language implying universal knowledge or certainty?

Finding: Not explicitly—no phrases like “everybody knows” or “clearly.”

Ground truth for step 2: yes 

Result: Does not match ground truth.

Summary of Matches from Step 2

Matches:

Anthropomorphism (but very general)

Inconsistency (a close logical relative)

Non-matches:

Alternative Advance

Alleged Certainty

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
While Anthropomorphism is present (gods endowed with human traits), the core issue is the direct contradiction between immortality and the notion of a true “sacrifice,” which hinges on death or permanent loss. Both Conflicting Conditions and the broader Inconsistency fallacy match perfectly—but Conflicting Conditions is the most precise label for the specific pattern of two mutually incompatible premises about Pele and her daughter.

Final Classification: Conflicting Conditions
Reasoning:

The argument simultaneously asserts that Pele is immortal and that her daughter was killed—a direct logical impossibility under the same mythological framework.

All diagnostic steps for Conflicting Conditions are satisfied without exception, making it the strongest and most specific fit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success.  So believe me when I tell you that there is no better hobby than cat-juggling.

LLM Response:
STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
After comparing the statement

“I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success. So believe me when I tell you that there is no better hobby than cat-juggling.”
against every fallacy’s prescribed steps in final_instructions.json, the strongest match is with Appeal to Accomplishment. This fallacy’s steps are:

Is an argument or claim being made?

Yes: the claim is “there is no better hobby than cat-juggling.”

Is the argument being defended or attacked based on the arguer’s level of accomplishment rather than the argument’s merit?

Yes: the speaker invokes their “share of success” and experience.

Is the argument’s truth value being established through the accomplishments of the person making it?

Yes: “believe me” because of the speaker’s track record.

Does the logical connection rely on status/achievement rather than factual evidence or sound reasoning?

Yes: no hobby-comparison evidence is offered, only the speaker’s authority.

All four steps align with the ground truths for Appeal to Accomplishment 
.

STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, the fallacies most often confused with appeal_to_accomplishment are:

appeal_to_false_authority

argument_from_false_authority 

We re-ran the full step-by-step analyses for each:

Appeal to False Authority

The speaker does cite themselves as an authority, but false authority requires that the authority be unqualified in the relevant field. Here the speaker’s accomplishments are presented as directly relevant to judging hobbies. There’s no separate “authority” (celebrity, expert) invoked on an unrelated domain.

Conclusion: does not cleanly match the ground truths for Appeal to False Authority.

Argument from False Authority

This fallacy likewise requires reliance on a claimed authority whose expertise is unrelated to the claim. While our speaker leans on personal accomplishment, they are not invoking an irrelevant external authority.

Conclusion: does not satisfy the ground-truth steps for Argument from False Authority.

STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Accomplishment fits all of its diagnostic steps perfectly: the argument’s only support is the speaker’s own achievements.

The two commonly confused fallacies fail their respective criteria here because there is no misuse of a separate authority figure—only self-referenced accomplishments.

Logically and semantically, the speaker is saying “Trust me because I’ve succeeded,” rather than offering any comparative data or reasoning about hobbies.

Therefore, the statement commits the Appeal to Accomplishment fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Are you tired of being ignored by your government?  Is it right that the top 1% have so much when the rest of us have so little?  I urge you to vote for me today!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Emotion)
Applying the Appeal to Emotion instructions from final_instructions.json:

Is a claim being made?
Yes – the speaker urges “I urge you to vote for me today!” 

Is legitimate evidence or logical reasoning provided?
No – there’s no factual support, only emotionally charged questions. 

Is emotional content used as the primary justification?
Yes – appeals to feeling ignored, injustice, and resentment at inequality. 

Is the emotional appeal intended to manipulate acceptance of the conclusion?
Yes – it leverages sympathy/anger to secure the vote rather than argument. 

All four criteria match the ground truth for Appeal to Emotion (yes, no, yes, yes).

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.txt, the fallacies often confused with Appeal to Emotion are:

Alleged Certainty

Prejudicial Language

Appeal to the Law

Wishful Thinking

Self-Righteousness Fallacy

For each, we ran the full JSON–based checklist internally and found mismatches with their ground truths (i.e., the statement does not exhibit their defining features).

Alleged Certainty

No expressions of “universal knowledge” or certainty language (“everybody knows”, “clearly”).

Prejudicial Language

No usage of derogatory or loaded descriptors aimed at a protected class.

Appeal to the Law

No invocation of legality/morality linkage.

Wishful Thinking

No leap from “how I’d like things to be” to “therefore they are true.”

Self-Righteousness Fallacy

No framing of opposition as morally or spiritually corrupt to dismiss their view.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Emotion is the only fallacy whose entire step-by-step criteria align perfectly with the statement (4/4 matches).

All related/confused fallacies fail at least one core criterion when applied to this statement.

The argument’s structure rests solely on emotional manipulation—sympathy for the overlooked and anger at inequality—to induce a vote, without any substantive evidence or logical support.

Conclusion: This is a clear case of Appeal to Emotion.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Fallacy Identified: Appeal to Authority
According to the instructions for Appeal to Authority, we check:

Does the argument cite an authority, expert, or credible source?

Yes: Richard Dawkins, a well-known evolutionary biologist, is cited.

Does the argument claim something is true solely because the authority said so?

Yes: The sole premise is “Dawkins says evolution is true, therefore it is true.”

Is the authority actually qualified in the relevant field?

Yes: Dawkins is indeed a leading expert in evolutionary biology.

Does the argument follow the pattern “Expert X says Y, therefore Y is true”?

Yes: It precisely matches that form.
All four internal answers are “yes,” matching the ground truth for Appeal to Authority 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, Appeal to Authority is often confused with:

Appeal to False Authority 

Blind Authority Fallacy 

Appeal to Trust 

Righteousness Fallacy 

We apply each’s instruction set:

Related Fallacy	Steps (ground_truth)	Statement Analysis	Match?
Appeal to False Authority	1. Authority cited? (yes) 2. Expert relevant? (no) 3. Relies on irrelevant authority? (yes) 
1 Yes. 2 No – Dawkins is relevant, so this step fails. 3 No.	❌
Blind Authority Fallacy	1. Argument made? (yes) 2. Evidence provided? (no) 3. Accepted solely because authority said so? (yes) 
1 Yes. 2 No – no independent evidence is offered. 3 Yes.	✅
Appeal to Trust	1. Source referenced? (yes) 2. Source deemed trustworthy/untrustworthy? (yes) 3. Claim attributed to that source? (yes) 4. Conclusion based solely on trust? (yes) 
All four are “yes.”	✅
Righteousness Fallacy	1. Authority cited? (yes) 2. Authority’s righteousness assumed? (no) 3. Conclusion drawn from righteousness? (yes) 
Step 2 fails – there’s no claim about Dawkins’s moral “righteousness.”	❌

Blind Authority Fallacy matches steps 1–3 exactly.

Appeal to Trust also matches all four steps.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Authority perfectly fits (all four steps “yes”).

Among related fallacies, Blind Authority and Appeal to Trust also match, but both are subtypes or close variants of the broader Appeal to Authority.

Of these, Appeal to Authority is the canonical label for “Expert X says Y, therefore Y is true,” whereas the others highlight more specific nuances (blind acceptance or trust).

Conclusion:
The statement commits the Appeal to Authority fallacy because it relies solely on Richard Dawkins’s status as an expert to establish the truth of evolution, without adducing any independent evidence or argument 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Tom Cruise says on TV that Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is.  Tom Cruise is awesome -- especially in MI4 when he scaled that building with only one suction glove; therefore, Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The statement is:

“Tom Cruise says on TV that Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is. Tom Cruise is awesome – especially in MI4 when he scaled that building with only one suction glove; therefore, Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is!”

Fallacy Identified: Appeal to Celebrity

A celebrity (Tom Cruise) is making a claim or endorsement.

His fame/status is used as the primary reason to accept the claim.
Both of these conditions match the Appeal to Celebrity ground-truths 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

Related Fallacy(s):
From the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Celebrity is often confused with Argument from False Authority 
.

For Argument from False Authority:

The person (Tom Cruise) is presented as an authority or figure of experience.

His actual expertise (acting, stunts) is not related to judging butter taste.

His authority is used to influence opinions on an unrelated topic.
This matches the ground-truth pattern for Argument from False Authority (yes, no, yes) 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
While both fallacies technically apply—with Tom Cruise’s celebrity status standing in for genuine expertise—the strongest, most direct fit is Appeal to Celebrity. The argument hinges explicitly on Cruise’s fame (“Tom Cruise is awesome…”) rather than on any assertion about his specific qualifications. Although one could also view it as a false authority (he’s unqualified on butter), the core error is leveraging a famous person’s status to sell a product.

Conclusion: The statement commits the Appeal to Celebrity fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
After the terrorist attack on the city, the citizens were outraged and wanted justice. So they arrested a Muslim man with no alibi who looked suspicious then charged him with the crime.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Scapegoating)
Using the instructions for Scapegoating:

Steps

Is there blame being assigned to a person or group?

Is the blamed party unpopular, or an easy target?

Is the blame disproportionate or unfair given the evidence?

Does the blamed party actually have a causal connection to the problem?

Does the blame deflect attention from more likely or complex causes?
Ground-truth: [yes, yes, yes, no, yes] 

Applying these to the statement:

“After the terrorist attack on the city, the citizens were outraged and wanted justice. So they arrested a Muslim man with no alibi who looked suspicious then charged him with the crime.”

Blame assigned? Yes—the Muslim man is held responsible.

Unpopular/easy target? Yes; Muslims are a minority often scapegoated after such events.

Disproportionate/unfair? Yes; there’s no evidence beyond “looks suspicious.”

Causal connection? No; there’s no link between him and the attack.

Deflects attention? Yes; it simplifies justice by blaming one individual, avoiding a real investigation.

All answers match the ground truth pattern exactly, confirming Scapegoating.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, Scapegoating is often confused with:

Rationalization 

Appeal to Heaven 

Spiritual Fallacy 

We apply each in turn:

Rationalization
Steps

Is the statement defending a claim?

Are there reasons provided to defend the claim?

Are the stated reasons the genuine motivation?

Are there more authentic reasons not provided?

Are the provided reasons more persuasive than the true ones?

Are false reasons substituted for the true reason?
Ground-truth: [yes, yes, no, yes, yes, yes] 

Application

Defending a claim? Yes—they justify arresting as “justice.”

Reasons given? Yes—“no alibi,” “looked suspicious.”

Genuine motivation? No—their real motive is fear/prejudice, not suspicion.

Authentic reasons omitted? Yes—anger, prejudice, desire for a quick culprit.

Reasons more persuasive? Yes—“suspicious” sounds plausible even if false.

False reasons substituted? Yes—they hide prejudice behind “lack of alibi.”

This also matches Rationalization’s ground truth exactly.

Appeal to Heaven
Steps

Does the argument invoke divine will as justification?

…
Ground-truth: [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]

Application: No divine or spiritual justification is invoked. Fails at step 1.

Spiritual Fallacy
Steps

Is a problematic claim taken literally?

Is it reframed as “spiritual” to avoid scrutiny?
…
Ground-truth: [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] 

Application: No spiritual reframing occurs. Fails at step 1.

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning

Both Scapegoating and Rationalization perfectly match their respective ground-truth patterns.

Scapegoating pinpoints the core mechanism: an innocent person is blamed to deflect from real causes.

Rationalization describes how false excuses (prejudice masked as “no alibi”) are offered, but it doesn’t capture the full social-psychological dynamic of blaming a scapegoat.

Conclusion: The statement is best classified as Scapegoating—the citizens unfairly assign blame to an innocent individual to satisfy collective outrage and avoid a genuine investigation.

Example: 
Bill: Steve, I am sorry to say, but you are a horrible driver! Steve: Why do you say that? Bill: This is your fourteenth accident this year. Steve: It’s just been an unlucky year for me.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Candidate: Accident Fallacy
According to the JSON instructions, the Accident Fallacy is characterized by applying a general rule without regard for exceptions, and treating that rule as having no exceptions whatsoever 
. Applying each step to Bill’s argument:

General rule or principle?
Bill implicitly invokes: “If you have many accidents, you must be a horrible driver.” → Yes.

Rule applied universally?
He applies it to Steve’s case without considering any mitigating factors. → Yes.

Are legitimate exceptions possible?
Yes: factors like bad luck, road conditions, mechanical failure, etc., could explain multiple accidents. → Yes.

Argument ignores these exceptions?
Bill dismisses any explanation beyond poor driving. → Yes.

Conclusion treats rule as absolute?
Bill concludes “you are a horrible driver” as though no exceptions exist. → Yes.

All five ground‐truth answers match “yes,” so Accident Fallacy is a perfect fit.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, the Accident Fallacy is often confused with Equivocation 
.

Equivocation involves shifting the meaning of a key term within an argument 
.

Applying its three steps to the same dialogue:

Key terms appear multiple times?
Bill’s statements use “accident” and “driver,” but there is no shift in meaning of any single term. → No.

Multiple meanings of that term used?
Not applicable. → No.

Misleading reinterpretation?
There is none. → No.

None of the ground‐truth conditions for Equivocation are met—so it does not fit Steve’s case.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Accident Fallacy matched all its diagnostic criteria.

Equivocation (the primary related/confused fallacy) matched none of its criteria.

Conclusion: Bill’s dismissal of Steve as “a horrible driver” solely because of fourteen accidents this year exemplifies the Accident Fallacy—it treats a generalization as absolute, ignoring any possible exceptions (e.g., bad luck) in order to discredit Steve’s driving skill.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earth was the center of the universe.  This was seen as enough of a reason back then to accept this as true.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Candidate Fallacy: Appeal to Common Belief

Instruction set (from Logical Fallacy JSON Instructions)

Does the argument claim that many/most people believe something?

Is this popular belief presented as evidence for the truth of the claim?

Does the argument have independent evidence beyond the appeal to numbers?

Does the argument follow the pattern: “Many people believe X, therefore X is true”?
• Ground truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “no”, “yes”] 

Execution:

The statement explicitly says “most people believed” → yes.

It presents that belief as “enough of a reason…to accept this as true” → yes.

No historical or scientific evidence is offered beyond “most people believed it” → no.

It concludes truth solely because of the majority belief → yes.

All four step-results match the fallacy’s ground truths.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Common Belief is often confused with:

Appeal to Popularity 

Analysis of Appeal to Popularity
Instruction set (from Logical Fallacy JSON Instructions)

Does the argument use popularity as evidence?

Is popularity the reason the conclusion is accepted?

Does the argument treat popularity as sufficient justification for truth or correctness?
• Ground truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “yes”] 

Execution:

“Most people believed…” ⇒ yes.

That belief is what makes it “enough of a reason” ⇒ yes.

No other justification is given beyond “popular” acceptance ⇒ yes.

All three step-results match the fallacy’s ground truths.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both Appeal to Common Belief and Appeal to Popularity perfectly fit this statement. However, the text frames the issue as a matter of what most people believed rather than merely what was popular in practice. Moreover, the Appeal to Common Belief fallacy’s instruction set explicitly tests for absence of independent evidence—a nuance that the statement illustrates (“no other evidence beyond common belief”).

Selected Fallacy: Appeal to Common Belief
Reasoning:

The claim rests entirely on the fact that “most people believed” it, with no further justification.

This matches the two key elements of the Appeal to Common Belief pattern and its ground truths (yes/yes/no/yes).

Although closely related, Appeal to Popularity lacks the explicit test for “independent evidence,” which is central here.

Thus, on balance, Appeal to Common Belief is the best classification.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
My fellow Americans, I am just like you.  Sure, I have a few private jets and homes in twelve countries, but I put on my pants one leg at a time, just like you common people.  So believe me when I say, this increase in taxes for the common folk is just what we all need.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis – “Appeal to Common Folk”

In final_instructions.json, the entry for Appeal to Common Folk lays out these diagnostic steps (all expected answers “yes”) 
:

Emphasis on shared common background?
The speaker insists, “I am just like you common people,” highlighting their ordinary–folk status.

Establishing connection via that shared background?
By invoking shared experiences (“put on my pants one leg at a time”), they reinforce an identity bond with the audience.

Using that connection as the primary basis for acceptance?
No substantive evidence is offered for the tax increase; instead, the argument rests entirely on their “common folk” cred.

Follows the pattern “We are common, so accept what I say”?
It matches precisely: “You are common people → I am common people → Therefore, believe my policy proposal.”

All four steps clearly return “yes,” perfectly matching the ground truths for this fallacy 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery

A search of prolog.txt confirms that Appeal to Common Folk is listed as a recognized fallacy, but there are no often_confused_with entries for it, indicating it isn’t commonly mistaken for another specific fallacy 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Having run the prescribed step-by-step analysis:

Strength of match: Every diagnostic question for Appeal to Common Folk is affirmed without any ambiguity.

Logical consistency: No other fallacy in the instructions covers this exact pattern of invoking shared ordinariness to sway an audience.

Absence of strong contenders: With no related fallacies suggested, there is no competing candidate requiring parallel evaluation.

Conclusion: The statement is a textbook Appeal to Common Folk fallacy. It seeks to persuade by asserting a shared “common people” identity rather than by adducing relevant evidence or sound reasoning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. So don't tell me not to hit my kids.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We locate the Appeal to Common Sense entry in the JSON instructions, which specifies these steps:

Does the argument claim something is “common sense” or “obvious”?

Does the “common sense” assertion actually require further evidence?

Does the argument fail to provide actual reasoning or evidence beyond the “common sense” claim? 

Applying these to the statement “It’s common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. So don’t tell me not to hit my kids.” yields:

Step 1: Yes – the speaker explicitly invokes “common sense.”

Step 2: Yes – whether smacking children is effective clearly demands empirical support.

Step 3: Yes – no evidence or logical reasoning beyond “common sense” is provided.

All three checks match the ground truths (yes, yes, yes), so the pattern perfectly conforms to the Appeal to Common Sense.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
We searched the Prolog relationships for any often_confused_with(appeal_to_common_sense, X) or vice versa but found no entries linking this fallacy to others in the knowledge base 
.

Related/Confused Fallacies: None identified

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Having analysed all candidates and found no competing confusions, the Appeal to Common Sense is conclusively the best fit because:

It matches every stipulated step in the JSON instructions with “yes” responses.

No alternative fallacy in the Prolog file is flagged as often confused with it.

Logically, the speaker’s reliance on “common sense” alone—without evidence—exactly embodies this fallacy’s definition.

Selected Fallacy: Appeal to Common Sense

Reasoning Summary:
The argument rests solely on an unsubstantiated assertion of “common sense,” sidestepping any demonstration or empirical support. This is precisely the hallmark of the Appeal to Common Sense fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Bill the Eye Guy: The development of the eye is monophyletic, meaning they have their origins in a proto-eye that evolved around 540 million years ago. Multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel. We know this partly because eyes in various animals show adaption to their requirements. Toby: Uh, that sounds made up. I don't think the eye could have evolved.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Argument from Incredulity)
According to final_instructions.json, Argument from Incredulity is defined with these steps and ground truth:

Identify if a person is making a claim. – Bill asserts that eyes evolved from a proto-eye. ✔️

Identify if a second person expresses disbelief or refusal to believe the first person's claim. – Toby responds “that sounds made up” and “I don’t think the eye could have evolved.” ✔️

Identify if the second person's conclusion is supported by additional evidence. – Toby offers no further evidence or reasoning beyond his disbelief. ✔️
Ground truth: [yes, yes, no] → our result [yes, yes, no] matches exactly 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, fallacies often confused with argument_from_incredulity are:

Appeal to Complexity

Appeal to Intuition

Appeal to Loyalty 

For each:

Appeal to Complexity (“I can’t understand it, so it must be wrong”)

Does Toby claim he doesn’t understand the argument? → No (he simply dismisses it as “made up”).

Does he conclude the argument is false/flawed? → Yes.

Is that conclusion based solely on lack of understanding? → No.

Ground truth: [yes, yes, yes] → actual [no, yes, no] → mismatch.

Appeal to Intuition (“It seems unbelievable, so it’s false”)

Does the argument rely primarily on intuition or gut feeling? → Yes (“sounds made up”).

Does Toby provide logical reasons? → No (he gives none).

Is the conclusion based on intuitive feeling rather than analysis? → Yes.

Ground truth: [yes, no, yes] → actual [yes, no, yes] → matches 
.

Appeal to Loyalty (“You must agree because you share my loyalty”)

Is loyalty used as the main reasoning? → No.

Ground truth: [yes, yes, yes, yes] → actual [no, –, – ,–] → mismatch.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Argument from Incredulity matched all its ground‐truth conditions perfectly.

Appeal to Intuition also matched its ground truth, but it is a subset of the broader incredulity fallacy, focusing only on gut feeling.

Appeal to Complexity and Appeal to Loyalty failed key steps.

Between the two perfect matches, Argument from Incredulity is the most precise classification for Toby’s line “Uh, that sounds made up. I don’t think the eye could have evolved,” because it captures the structure: “I don’t believe X → therefore X is false” without any other justification. Appeal to Intuition is a close relative (and was one of the related fallacies), but Argument from Incredulity is the direct pattern specified in the instructions and best fits the statement’s form and ground truths.

Final Answer:
Argument from Incredulity – Toby dismisses the claim solely because he finds it unbelievable, matching [yes, yes, no] exactly.

Example: 
If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death.  I want to be rewarded; therefore, morality must be objective.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Candidate Fallacy: Affirming the Consequent

Step 1: “Is there a conditional statement (If P then Q)?”

Yes. The argument begins “If there is objective morality (P), then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death (Q).” 

Step 2: “Is the consequent (Q) stated as true?”

Yes. The arguer asserts “I want to be rewarded,” effectively affirming Q. 

Step 3: “Does the reasoning flow from Q being true to P being true?”

Yes. From “I will be rewarded (Q), therefore morality must be objective (P).” 

Comparison to Ground Truth: All three answers match the expected pattern [yes, yes, yes] for Affirming the Consequent. 

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
Looking in prolog.pro, Affirming the Consequent is often confused with Commutation of Conditionals:

prolog
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(affirming_the_consequent, commutation_of_conditionals).
often_confused_with(commutation_of_conditionals, affirming_the_consequent).
—

Related Fallacy: Commutation of Conditionals

Step 1: “Identify if a statement is being made.” → Yes. A clear claim is presented.

Step 2: “Identify if the statement contains conditional relationships such as an (if P then Q) format.” → Yes. “If P then Q.” 

Step 3: “Identify if the antecedent and consequent have been switched.” → Yes. The conclusion asserts “If Q then P.” 

Step 4: “Identify if the switched antecedent–consequent is assumed to be true.” → Yes. The arguer assumes Q→P without question. 

Step 5: “Identify if the switched antecedent–consequent (if Q then P) pair is logically correct.” → No. A conditional does not in general reverse validity. 

Comparison to Ground Truth: The pattern [yes, yes, yes, yes, no] matches exactly for Commutation of Conditionals. 

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both analyses align perfectly with their respective ground truths. However:

Affirming the Consequent is the standard, widely recognized name for the error of inferring the antecedent from an affirmed consequent.

Commutation of Conditionals is a more formal/logical description of the same structure, emphasizing the reversal of “if P then Q” to “if Q then P.”

Given the context—a lay argument about morality—it is most natural to label this as Affirming the Consequent, the common‐usage name for this formal fallacy.

Final Classification: Affirming the Consequent
Reasoning Summary:

The argument takes “If P then Q” as its premise, affirms Q, and concludes P—exactly fitting the three‐step pattern for Affirming the Consequent.

While it also meets the criteria for Commutation of Conditionals, the conventional name Affirming the Consequent is preferred for clarity and ease of communication.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Ken: Do you think gay marriage should be legalized? Paul: Absolutely not!  Marriage is defined as the union between a man and a woman—not between two men or two women! Ken: Did you know that in 1828 the dictionary definition of marriage included, “for securing the maintenance and education of children”?  Does that mean that all married couples who can’t or choose not to have children aren’t really married? Paul: No, it just means they need to buy updated dictionaries. Ken: As do you.  The current Merriam-Webster Dictionary includes as a secondary definition, “the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage.”

LLM Response:
Below is the exact execution of the three‐step Fallacy Analysis Task for the provided exchange between Ken and Paul.

STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Fallacy Identified: Appeal to Definition
(Source: “Appeal to Definition” entry in final_instructions.json) 

Step	Observation	Ground Truth	Match?
1. Is a dictionary definition being used as the primary evidence?	Paul insists “Marriage is defined as the union between a man and a woman.”	yes	✔️
2. Does the argument claim a term cannot have meanings beyond the dictionary definition?	He denies the legitimacy of any meaning outside that strict, historical definition.	yes	✔️
3. Does the argument dismiss expanded, alternative, or evolved meanings of a term?	He says those who accept same‐sex marriage “need to buy updated dictionaries.”	yes	✔️
4. Is a contextual or specialized meaning rejected solely because it doesn’t match the dictionary definition?	Paul rejects Ken’s citation of a current Merriam-Webster definition simply because it’s not the one he first quoted.	yes	✔️
5. (Implicit) Does the conclusion rely on this rejection of evolved meaning as sole justification?	His entire refusal (“Absolutely not!”) hinges on that narrow definition.	yes	✔️

All five steps align with the ground truths for Appeal to Definition.

STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
Related Fallacy(s): Etymological Fallacy
(Source: Prolog relation often_confused_with(appeal_to_definition, etymological_fallacy)) 

For each related fallacy we repeat the step‐by‐step analysis:

Etymological Fallacy
(Source: “Etymological Fallacy” entry in final_instructions.json) 

Step	Observation	Ground Truth	Match?
1. Identify if a word with different modern and historical meanings is mentioned.	“Marriage” historically meant “for securing maintenance and education of children”; modern definitions include same-sex unions.	yes	✔️
2. Identify if both the modern and historic meanings of the word are referenced.	Ken cites the 1828 definition; Paul refers to the traditional “man and woman” definition; Ken then cites the current Merriam-Webster addition.	yes	✔️
3. Identify if the historical meaning is seen as the true meaning of the word.	Paul treats the older dictionary entry as the exclusively valid one and dismisses the newer usage.	yes	✔️

All three steps align with the ground truths for Etymological Fallacy.

STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Fallacy	# of Steps	All Ground-Truth Matches?	Notes
Appeal to Definition	5	Yes	Directly uses a dictionary definition as sole authority; ignores evolved meanings.
Etymological Fallacy	3	Yes	Relies on historical meaning as the only valid one—but is narrower in scope than Appeal to Definition.

While both misuses of definitions are present, Appeal to Definition is the more precise characterization:

Scope & Primary Mechanism: Paul’s entire argument relies on the canonical dictionary entry, explicitly elevating it above any evolved or contextual usage.

Completeness of Match: It satisfies all five steps in its instruction set, whereas Etymological Fallacy covers only three.

Logical Fit: The core error is not merely invoking history, but claiming that “dictionary definition = sole correct meaning,” exactly the pattern encoded by Appeal to Definition.

Therefore, the statement is best classified as an Appeal to Definition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
These are desperate times, and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Therefore, I propose we exterminate all baby seals.  It is obvious that something must be done, and this is something.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Applying the instructions for “Appeal to Desperation” from Logical Fallacy JSON Instructions:

“Is there is a claim that ‘something must be done’ about a situation or problem?”

The statement begins with “These are desperate times, and desperate times call for desperate measures,” explicitly asserting that action is required. 

“Is there a specific solution (X) being proposed?”

Yes: “I propose we exterminate all baby seals.” 

“Does the argument justify the solution mainly because of the urgency of the situation rather than based on its actual merits?”

The only justification offered is the urgency of “desperate times,” with no evidence about why exterminating baby seals is effective or appropriate. 

“Does the reasoning follow this pattern: urgent need exists → this is a response → therefore this response must be adopted?”

Yes: urgent need (“desperate times”) → extermination proposal → thus adopt extermination. 

“Does the argument lack proper evaluation of the proposed solution’s effectiveness or appropriateness?”

There is no discussion of alternatives, feasibility, morality, ecological impact, or any merits beyond urgency. 

All five steps match the ground truths (“yes” for each), so the statement is classified as an Appeal to Desperation.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
Searching prolog.txt for often_confused_with(appeal_to_desperation,…) yields no entries—there are no fallacies frequently confused with “Appeal to Desperation” in this Prolog knowledge base. 

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
After evaluating all candidate fallacies (Step 1) and finding no closely related/confusable fallacies (Step 2), “Appeal to Desperation” remains the best—and indeed only—fit.

Strength of match with ground truths:
Every diagnostic step for “Appeal to Desperation” returns “yes,” exactly matching its ground truth vector 
.

Quality of step-by-step analysis:
Each criterion directly corresponds to a distinct feature of the argument, with no ambiguity or partial matches.

Logical consistency:
The argument’s structure perfectly aligns with the form “urgent problem → proposed remedy → therefore remedy,” and lacks any substantive evaluation—hallmarks of the “Appeal to Desperation” pattern.

Conclusion:
The statement is definitively an Appeal to Desperation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Power lines cause cancer.  I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, “Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.”  I urge you to vote for this bill to tear down all power lines and replace them with monkeys on treadmills.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Identified Fallacy: Hasty Generalization

Sample used as evidence? Yes – The speaker relies on a single anecdote (one boy with cancer) as evidence.

Sample size unreasonably small? Yes – A single case cannot represent all children.

Sample unrepresentative? Yes – That one boy’s proximity (20 miles) to power lines is not statistically representative of all cases.

Broad conclusion drawn? Yes – “Power lines cause cancer.”

Conclusion applied to larger population? Yes – The speaker urges removal of all power lines.

Ignores larger statistical data? Yes – No epidemiological studies or broader data are cited.

All six required conditions are met 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, hasty_generalization is often_confused_with the following fallacies:

Related Fallacy	Prolog Source
False Effect	
Fantasy Projection	
Appeal to Closure	
Scapegoating	
Subverted Support	
Biased Sample Fallacy	
Ecological Fallacy	
Misleading Vividness	
Package Deal Fallacy	
Tokenism	
Post-Designation	

For each of these, we briefly applied the JSON “steps → ground_truth” check:

False Effect – Steps require a causal claim dismissed due to a fallacious inference of effect; here the speaker is affirming causation, not dismissing it. ⇒ Mismatch.

Fantasy Projection – Involves projecting outcomes into the future; our argument uses a present anecdote. ⇒ Mismatch.

Appeal to Closure – Centers on a desire to “close” debate; while there is urgency, the core is anecdotal rather than closure-seeking. ⇒ Mismatch.

Scapegoating – Blames a group/entity for a problem without evidence; here the speaker does blame power lines but uses anecdote, fitting Hasty Generalization more directly. ⇒ Partial fit but emotional/pity aspects secondary.

Subverted Support – Inserts contradictory support while denying it; not present. ⇒ Mismatch.

Biased Sample Fallacy – Very close: relies on a non-representative sample. However JSON distinguishes it by requiring an intentionally biased sample meant to represent a larger group. Here the speaker likely isn’t deliberately biasing, but simply misusing anecdote. ⇒ Partial fit but Hasty Generalization criteria match more precisely.

Ecological Fallacy – Inferring individual characteristics from group data; opposite of our case. ⇒ Mismatch.

Misleading Vividness – Overemphasizing a dramatic example to generalize; overlaps, but our focus is on the size of the sample rather than its vividness. ⇒ Partial fit, but JSON “Hasty Generalization” criteria align exactly.

Package Deal Fallacy – Combines several unrelated facts to support a conclusion; not occurring here. ⇒ Mismatch.

Tokenism – Using a token example to generalize; extremely close, but JSON’s “Tokenism” requires explicitly presenting a token as typical, whereas here the speaker uses one anecdote to infer a universal cause. ⇒ Very close, yet still best described by “Hasty Generalization.”

Post-Designation – Ascribing retrospective labels to fit a narrative; not present. ⇒ Mismatch.

Summary of Related Analysis:
While several related fallacies (Biased Sample, Misleading Vividness, Tokenism) share features, none match all six strict criteria for “Hasty Generalization.” Only Hasty Generalization meets every JSON step exactly in sequence 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
The statement “Power lines cause cancer…” rests entirely on a single, unrepresentative anecdote and leaps to a universal conclusion about all children and power lines. This satisfies every step for Hasty Generalization:

Sample used? Yes

Sample size too small? Yes

Unrepresentative sample? Yes

Broad conclusion drawn? Yes

Conclusion applied universally? Yes

Ignores broader data? Yes 

Other candidate fallacies fail at least one of these steps or impose additional requirements not met here. Therefore, Hasty Generalization is the most accurate classification.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
If women get paid maternity leave, so should men.

LLM Response:
Final Classification: False Equivalence

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We evaluated the statement:

“If women get paid maternity leave, so should men.”

Against Appeal to Equality (four‐step analysis) and found it to match perfectly:

Claim of equality? Yes – equates “women’s paid maternity leave” with “men’s paid ____ leave.”

Substantiation? No – no justification that the two are truly equivalent.

Unsupported/vague equality? Yes – the comparison rests on a single shared characteristic (being human), ignoring critical differences.

Conclusion depends entirely on that equality? Yes – the “should” rests solely on the asserted equivalence 
.

However, a deeper, more precise fit emerges with False Equivalence, which features a richer six‐step diagnostic.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Equality is most often confused with False Equivalence 
.

Step 2b: Analysis of False Equivalence
We ran the full six‐step check from the JSON instructions:

Are two completely different things compared?
– Women’s maternity leave vs. men’s leave. These are distinct in purpose and biology.

Is equivalence claimed?
– Yes: “so should men.”

Do they share only very few characteristics?
– They share being employees who might take leave—but the similarity is superficial.

Are the shared traits minor compared to significant differences?
– Yes: childbirth vs. no childbirth involvement.

Have key distinguishing factors been ignored or oversimplified?
– Yes: only mothers biologically require maternity leave.

Is the equivalence logically invalid given the magnitude of differences?
– Yes.

All six steps yield “yes,” exactly matching the False Equivalence ground truths 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning
Both Appeal to Equality and False Equivalence fit the statement, but False Equivalence provides a more granular, logically rigorous diagnosis:

Appeal to Equality focuses on an unsubstantiated claim of equality (4 steps).

False Equivalence explicitly examines the nature and weight of similarities versus differences (6 steps), and our statement satisfies every one of its criteria.

Therefore, False Equivalence is the strongest match, offering superior analytical precision and a fuller alignment with the provided ground truths.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
There is no way those Girl Scouts could have sold all those cases of cookies in one hour.  If they did, they would have to make $500 in one hour, which, based on an 8 hour day is over a million dollars a year.  That is more than most lawyers, doctors, and successful business people make!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification – Appeal to Consequences
The speaker concludes that the Girl Scouts could not have sold all those cookie cases in one hour because doing so would yield an implausibly high income (over $1 million per year), and “that is more than most lawyers, doctors, and successful business people make.” This rests entirely on the undesirable consequence (an improbably high annual income) rather than on direct evidence about how many cookies were sold. It perfectly matches every step and ground truth for the Appeal to Consequences fallacy as specified:

Claim about truth/falsity – “There is no way… they could have sold…”

Reasoning based on consequences – “If they did, they’d have to make $500 in one hour…”

Consequences described as undesirable – “over a million dollars a year… more than most professionals make”

Desirability used as justification – uses that “too much” income to reject the claim 

Step 2: Related Fallacy Exploration – Nirvana Fallacy
According to the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Consequences is often confused with the Nirvana Fallacy 
. The Nirvana Fallacy dismisses a realistic option (X) solely because it doesn’t match an ideal, perfect alternative (Y). Its JSON instructions require:

A realistic solution/situation (X) is presented.

An idealized/perfect scenario (Y) is introduced for comparison.

The realistic option is dismissed solely due to its imperfection.

Focus on benefits of the realistic solution rather than its shortcomings. 

In our statement, no perfect alternative is offered—only an appeal to the negative consequence of the hypothetical scenario—so it fails step 2 of the Nirvana Fallacy (and thus does not match its ground truths).

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning
Comparing both analyses:

Appeal to Consequences perfectly aligns (all four “yes” ground truths match).

Nirvana Fallacy does not align (fails to introduce or compare to an ideal scenario).

Therefore, the statement is best classified as an Appeal to Consequences.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Jimmie: Joseph Smith, the all American prophet, was the blond-haired, blue-eyed voice of God. Hollie: What is your evidence for that? Jimmie: I don't need evidence—I only need faith.

LLM Response:
Final Selection: Appeal to Faith

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Claim: “Joseph Smith ... was the blond-haired, blue-eyed voice of God.”

Question: “What is your evidence for that?”

Response: “I don’t need evidence—I only need faith.”

Applying the Appeal to Faith instructions from final_instructions.json:

Does the argument avoid reason because reason would disprove the conclusion?
Jimmie explicitly dismisses “evidence” and substitutes “faith” in its place—avoiding rational support entirely. ✔️ 

Does the statement assert that faith is required to understand or accept the argument?
Jimmie says “I only need faith,” making faith the sole basis for accepting the claim. ✔️ 

Both criteria match the ground truth of ["yes","yes"], confirming Appeal to Faith.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, Appeal to Faith is often confused with:

Spiritual Fallacy

Statement of Conversion 

A quick check shows neither better fits Jimmie’s response:

Spiritual Fallacy involves reframing a literal claim as “spiritual” to evade scrutiny—Jimmie does not do this.

Statement of Conversion hinges on personal conversion as sole justification—Jimmie isn’t recounting a conversion experience.

Step 3: Comprehensive Reasoning
Strength of match: Appeal to Faith aligns perfectly with both structured steps and ground truths.

Logical consistency: Jimmie’s refusal to provide evidence and reliance on “faith” is the textbook pattern.

Exclusivity: No other fallacy in the confusion set captures the central role of “faith” supplanting reason.

Therefore, the statement is best classified as an Appeal to Faith.

Example: 
My 5th-grade teacher once told me that girls would go crazy for boys if they learn how to dance.  Therefore, if you want to make the ladies go crazy for you, learn to dance.

LLM Response:
You are
After applying the “Questionable Cause” criteria to the statement—

“My 5th-grade teacher once told me that girls would go crazy for boys if they learn how to dance. Therefore, if you want to make the ladies go crazy for you, learn to dance.”

we find:

Causal claim (“dancing” ⇒ “girls go crazy”).

Only association offered (an anecdote from a teacher).

Inference of causation from mere association without further evidence.

All three conditions match the ground truth for Questionable Cause 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
According to the Prolog relationships, Questionable Cause is often confused with Casual Reductionism 
.

Analysis under “Casual Reductionism” 
:

Statement/claim? Yes—dance causes romantic excitement.

Multiple causes exist? Yes—attraction depends on many factors (personality, context, etc.).

Single-cause attribution? Yes—ignores all other influences, attributing attraction solely to dancing.

All three steps yield “yes,” matching its ground truth.

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning

Fallacy	Match Strength	Focus of Critique
These	✓✓✓	Infers causation purely from a single association.
Casual Reductionism	✓✓	Oversimplifies by attributing a multifactor outcome to one cause.

While both fallacies fit, Questionable Cause is the more precise classification here because the core error is inferring a causal link (dance ⇒ romantic obsession) directly from an anecdotal association without any supporting evidence. Casual Reductionism describes an oversimplification of causes, but the primary flaw in the argument is the leap from correlation to causation.

Therefore, the statement exemplifies the “Questionable Cause” fallacy.

Example: 
If we don’t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse.  Therefore, we need to bail out the automakers.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Candidate Fallacy: Appeal to Consequences

Claim about truth/falsity?

Yes. The argument asserts that “we need to bail out the automakers.”

Reasoning based on consequences rather than evidence?

Yes. It rests on the consequence (“the US economy will collapse”) rather than on direct evidence about automakers’ solvency or alternatives.

Consequences described as desirable/undesirable?

Yes. Economic collapse is presented as an undesirable outcome.

Desirability/undesirability used as primary justification?

Yes. The sole support for the bailout is avoiding the undesirable consequence.

All
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, Appeal to Consequences is often confused with the Nirvana Fallacy 
.

Nirvana Fallacy Analysis 
:

Realistic solution (X) presented?

Yes. The proposal to bail out automakers is a realistic policy option.

Idealized/perfect scenario (Y) presented?

No. There is no comparison to a perfect or unattainable alternative.

Realistic solution dismissed solely by comparison to perfect scenario?

Not applicable (since no perfect scenario is mentioned).

Argument fire

No; it focuses exclusively on avoiding collapse, not on how well the bailout works.

THE

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Consequences perfectly fits the structure:

A conditional (“If we don’t bail them out, the economy will collapse”) describes an adverse outcome.

The conclusion (“we need to bail out the automakers”) is drawn solely to avoid that undesirable consequence.

Nirvana Fallacy does not fit, as no unattainable ideal is invoked.

Conclusion:
This argument commits the Appeal to Consequences fallacy, since it infers that the bailout policy must be adopted purely to avert a feared outcome, rather than on evidence that the bailout itself is the best or only solution.

Example: 
You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!

LLM Response:
St
Applying the instructions for each fallacy in Logical Fallacy JSON Instructions to the statement:

“You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes — you are just so good at it!”

We quickly find that it perfectly fits Appeal to Flattery, whose steps are:

Is there an argument or claim being made?
– Yes: “You should be the one who washes the dishes.”

Are flattery or compliments directed toward the audience/listener?
– Yes: “and

Is the flattery being used as support for the argument instead of actual evidence or reasoning?
– Yes: the compliment is offered as the sole justification. 

All three “yes” responses match the fallacy’s ground truth ["yes","yes","yes"], so Appeal to Flattery is a precise match.

often_confused_with(appeal_to_flattery, argument_by_personal_charm).
Thus, Argument by Personal Charm is frequently confused with Appeal to Flattery 
.

We then apply its steps to the statement:

It goes
– Yes: “I

Identify if the argument’s strength is reliant on the person’s charm or personal characteristics.
– Yes: It highlights “so good at it” (a personal trait).

Identify if the person’s charm is unrelated to their argument.
–they specifically should do it.

Identify if the argument has other substantial supporting logical evidence.
– No: No other reasoning is offered beyond charm/flattery.

These map to ["yes","yes","yes","no"], matching the ground truth for Argument by Personal Charm exactly 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Both Appeal to Flattery and Argument by Personal Charm receive perfect “match” results against their respective ground truths.

However, the statement’s mechanism is more narrowly the classic flattery-based push (“you’re so good…”), rather than a broader “personal charm” tactic.

Conclusion: The best classification is Appeal to Flattery, because it precisely captures the use of compliments as the sole justification for the claim.

Example: 
Melvin: Boss, why do I have to work weekends when nobody else in the company does? Boss: Am I sensing insubordination?  I can find another employee very quickly, thanks to Craigslist, you know.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Force)
We apply the “Appeal to Force” instruction set from the JSON file to Melvin’s exchange:

Does the argument contain a threat?

Boss: “I can find another employee very quickly, thanks to Craigslist.”

Answer: Yes.

Is the threat directed at the person being asked to accept the conclusion?

Boss addresses Melvin directly, warning him of replacement.

Answer:Yes.

Is the threat intended to coerce agreement?

Implied coercion: accept weekend work or be replaced.

Answer: Yes.

I

No substantive justification why Melvin must work weekends beyond the threat.

Answer: No.

These answers match the ground-truth pattern for Appeal to Force: ["yes","yes","yes","no"] 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
Consulting the Prolog relationships (prolog.pro) identifies “Appeal to Fear” as often confused with Appeal to Force, since both invoke a fear-based motivator.

We now run the same step-by-step analysis for Appeal to Fear:

Does the

Yes: threat of replacement induces fear.

Does the argument lack substantial evidence or logical reasoning beyond the fear-based appeal?

Yes: no other justification given.

Ground truth for “Appeal to Fear” is ["yes","no"] 
, so our answers match perfectly.

You are

Both fallacies fit the statement: it uses fear/threat to force compliance.

However, Appeal to Force is the more specific fallacy: it explicitly describes a threat of harm (job loss) to coerce agreement, whereas Appeal to Fear covers a broader use of fear without necessarily an explicit threat.

The boss’s remark is a classic ad baculum (“by the stick”) scenario—coercion through a concrete threat—so A best captures the error in reasoning.

Final Class

Appeal to Force (Argumentum ad Baculum)

Reasoning Summary:

Melvin’s reasonable request (why work weekends?) is not addressed on its merits.

Instead, the boss threatens to replace him, coercing compliance by fear.

No additional logical or factual support is offered to justify mandatory weekend work.

This aligns exactly with the “Appeal to Force” pattern

],
"ground_truth": ["yes","yes","yes","yes"]
}
Step 2.1.1: Yes (Larry makes the claim “God told me…”).

Step 2.1.2: No — the language isn’t emotionally charged (no explicit appeal to pity, fear, etc.).

Step 2.1.3: N/A, because there is no emotive language.

Step 2.1.4: N/A.

Result: fails at Step 2.1.2 (does not match ground truth).

}
Step 2.2.1: Yes (there is a claim).

Step 2.2.2: No — no rapid speech is indicated.

Step 2.2.3: No — acceptance is due to divine claim, not fast delivery.

Step 2.2.4: No logical evidence is offered.

Result: fails at Steps 2.2.2 and 2.2.3.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Heaven fully satisfies all five of its prescribed steps (all “yes” vs. ground truth: yes×5).

Argument by Emotive Language and Argument by Fast Talking both fail at critical steps.

Therefore, Appeal to Heaven is the clear best fit:

It directly invokes divine command as sole justification.

It assumes certain knowledge of God’s will and excludes any other reasoning.

No other fallacy comes as close to the structure and content of “Because God told me to do it.”

Conclusion: The statement exemplifies the Appeal to Heaven fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Nick: Did you know that if the sun were just a few miles closer to Earth, we would burn up, or if it were just a few miles further away we would all freeze? It is like someone put the sun there just for us! Suzy: Actually, the distance of the sun from Earth varies from about 91 million miles to 94.5 million miles, depending on the time of year. Nick: That can't be right. The sun never appears a few million miles further away!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
After running the prescribed step-by-step checks on Nick’s final response (“That can’t be right…”), the pattern that matches most closely is Argument from Incredulity. According to the JSON instructions, this fallacy’s steps are:

A person makes a claim.

A second person expresses disbelief or refusal to believe the first person’s claim.

The second person’s conclusion is not supported by additional evidence. 

Applied to the dialogue:

Suzy: “Actually, the distance of the sun … varies…” (She makes a factual claim.)

Nick: “That can’t be right…” (He expresses disbelief.)

Nick offers no new data, only his perception (“sun never appears…”), so there is no additional evidence supporting his rejection.

All three of these line up perfectly with the ground_truth pattern for Argument from Incredulity (yes / yes / no) 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, the fallacies often confused with Argument from Incredulity are:

Appeal to Complexity

Appeal to Intuition

Appeal to Loyalty 

We ran the same three-step checks on each:

Appeal to Complexity

Step 1 (“Does the person claim they don’t understand the argument?”) – No (Nick doesn’t say “I don’t understand,” he just disbelieves).

Ground truth requires “yes” here, so fails.

Appeal to Intuition

Step 1: Yes (Nick relies on his “gut feeling” that the sun’s distance never seems to change).

Step 2 (“Does the person provide logical reasons?”): No (he offers no scientific or logical support, just his perception).

Step 3 (“Is the conclusion based on intuitive feelings?”): Yes.

That yields (yes / no / yes), which matches the ground_truth for Appeal to Intuition (yes / no / yes) 
.

Appeal to Loyalty

These steps (loyal relationship, etc.) are entirely inapplicable to the exchange—no loyalty or disloyalty is invoked—so fails.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Fallacy	Ground­Truth Match?	Comments
Argument from Incredulity	Perfect (yes/yes/no)	Fits exactly: disbelief without evidence.
Appeal to Intuition	Yes/No/Yes	Also matches its pattern—but is less precise (relies on feeling).
Appeal to Complexity	No	Nick does not claim confusion or complexity.
Appeal to Loyalty	N/A	No loyalty element present.

Selection: Argument from Incredulity
Reasoning: Nick explicitly rejects Suzy’s factual correction purely on the basis of his own inability or unwillingness to believe (“That can’t be right…”), without offering any new evidence or logical counter-argument. This is the hallmark of Argument from Incredulity, and it aligns exactly with the JSON-specified steps (yes / yes / no). While Appeal to Intuition shares some overlap, it is broader—Argument from Incredulity precisely captures the dynamic of “I don’t believe it, therefore it’s false,” making it the best fit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Cult leaders appear to have a magical level of influence over their followers. They can do no wrong, and anything they say must be true. This mindset is enforced by rewards and punishments related to loyalty. When Jim Jones claimed that hostile forces would convert captured children of the cult to fascism, no fact-checking was involved. Out of loyalty to the leader, Jones’ followers reasoned that suicide was a better alternative and “drank the Kool-Aid” (Flavor Aid). Nine hundred and nine inhabitants of Jonestown died of apparent cyanide poisoning. Three hundred and four of them were children.

LLM Response:
Selected Fallacy: Appeal to Loyalty

Reasoning (Step 1):
The cult followers’ reasoning hinges entirely on loyalty to Jim Jones—they accept his claims without question, and any doubt is framed as disloyalty or betrayal. Evaluating against the JSON-specified steps for Appeal to Loyalty confirms a perfect match:

Loyalty relationship present? Yes—the followers’ bond to Jones is explicit.

Loyalty as main reasoning? Yes—their ultimate choice of mass suicide was justified solely by loyalty.

Disagreement equated with betrayal? Yes—any dissent would be punished as disloyal or treasonous.

Truth independent of loyalty? They treat truth as inseparable from loyalty, ignoring external evidence. 

All four ground-truths are met (“yes, yes, yes, yes”), showing a strong, unambiguous fit.

Related Fallacies (Step 2):
From the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Loyalty is often confused with:

Argument from Incredulity 

Blind Authority Fallacy 

Traitorous Critic Fallacy 

Analysis of Related Fallacies:

Argument from Incredulity requires someone’s refusal to believe based on personal incredulity. Here, there is no expression of disbelief driving the conclusion, so it fails to match the ground-truth (“yes”, “yes”, “no”) for that fallacy.

Blind Authority Fallacy fits partially: the followers accept Jones’s claim solely because he is their leader, with no evidence (steps “yes”, “no”, “yes”) 
. However, the explicit mechanism is loyalty enforcement rather than mere deference to perceived expertise.

Traitorous Critic Fallacy involves attacking a critic’s loyalty rather than their argument (steps: “yes”, “yes”, “yes”, “no”, “yes”). While the cult punished dissenters as disloyal, this fallacy focuses on deflecting criticism, not on initial belief formation. The primary appeal in the statement is to loyalty as justification, not to discredit critics.

Final Comparison and Selection (Step 3):

Appeal to Loyalty matches all its prescribed steps directly and precisely.

Blind Authority Fallacy matches only because Jones is an authority figure, but it overlooks the loyalty-based reward/punishment dynamic that is central to the scenario.

Argument from Incredulity and Traitorous Critic Fallacy do not adequately capture the argument structure.

Conclusion: The statement is best classified as an Appeal to Loyalty. It most accurately explains how followers accepted Jones’s claims—and ultimately chose suicide—based solely on enforced loyalty, with disagreement equated to betrayal.

Example: 
I shop at Natural Happy Sunshine Store (NHSS), which is much better than your grocery store because at NHSS everything is natural including the 38-year-old store manager’s long gray hair and saggy breasts.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Fallacy Identified: Appeal to Nature
Instructions & Ground Truth:

Does the statement assign positive value judgments to the “natural” thing? Yes

Does the statement assign negative value judgments to the “unnatural” thing? Yes

Does the argument assume natural = good/positive and unnatural = bad/negative without other evidence? Yes

All responses match the ground truth of ["yes","yes","yes"] 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
According to the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Nature is often confused with Non Sequitur and Equivocation 
.

Non Sequitur

Steps:

Does the argument contain a conclusion? Yes

Does the argument present specific premises, evidence, or reasoning? Yes

Is the evidence or reason relevant to the conclusion? No

Ground Truth: ["yes","yes","no"] → Match 
.

Equivocation

Steps:

Identify if key terms appear multiple times. Yes (“natural” appears repeatedly)

Identify if multiple meanings of the same term are used. No (used in the same sense)

Identify if the statement relies on misinterpreting the ambiguous term to mislead. No

Ground Truth: ["yes","yes","yes"] → Mismatch 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Nature perfectly fits all its diagnostic criteria (all “yes” answers matching its ground truths).

Non Sequitur also matches its own ground truths, but the statement’s reasoning hinges specifically on equating “natural” with “better,” rather than simply presenting unrelated premises.

Equivocation fails to match its own ground truths, as there is no shift in meaning of “natural.”

Conclusion: The statement is best classified as an Appeal to Nature, because it asserts that “natural” attributes (including the manager’s gray hair and saggy breasts) inherently make NHSS superior, without any other substantive evidence. This aligns exactly with the fallacy’s pattern of assigning intrinsic moral or qualitative value to what is deemed “natural.”

Example: 
I am only slightly obese.  That is perfectly normal here in America.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Normality)
For the statement “I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America.”, we apply the “Appeal to Normality” instruction set from Logical Fallacy JSON Instructions:

Does the argument use social norms or what is considered ‘normal’ as evidence?
Yes – it cites what is “perfectly normal here in America.” 

Does the conclusion claim something is good/bad or desirable/undesirable?
Yes – describing slight obesity as “perfectly normal” implicitly frames it as acceptable/desirable. 

Does the reasoning connect normality directly to moral value or desirability?
Yes – because it’s “normal,” the speaker implies it’s fine. 

Does the argument assume normal = good or abnormal = bad?
Yes – equating “normal” with acceptability. 

Are there any other substantial evidence provided beyond social normality?
No – no health data, medical expertise, or other evidence is offered. 

Are there implied conclusions about goodness even if not explicitly stated?
Yes – by calling it “perfectly normal,” the speaker implies it’s harmless or appropriate. 

These answers exactly match the ground-truth vector ["yes","yes","yes","yes","no","yes"] for Appeal to Normality 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
A search of prolog.txt for often_confused_with(appeal_to_normality did not return any entries, indicating that Appeal to Normality is not explicitly linked to any commonly confused fallacies in the provided Prolog file 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Match Strength: The statement meets all “yes” criteria except for one (no other evidence), perfectly mirroring the ground truth for Appeal to Normality.

Logical Consistency: It relies solely on what is “normal” in America to justify obesity, a textbook instance of normality-based reasoning.

No Strong Confusions: With no related/confused fallacies identified in the Prolog relationships, there is no competing candidate that better fits the pattern.

Conclusion:
This statement is best classified as an Appeal to Normality, because it justifies a personal health condition by pointing to its prevalence or “normalcy” in a given society rather than by any substantive evidence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Two words: New Coke.

LLM Response:
After exhaustive review of every defined fallacy and their diagnostic criteria, the utterance

“Two words: New Coke.”

contains no substantive claim, premise–conclusion structure, or any inference at all—it’s simply a label. Because there’s no argument to unpack, none of the fallacies apply.

Final Classification:

No fallacy detected

Reasoning:

No claim or proposition beyond naming a product – there’s no assertion like “New Coke is…” that could carry premises or a conclusion.

No inferential move – without premises leading to a conclusion, diagnostic steps (e.g. “Is there a conditional?” or “Is an authority invoked?”) all fail at step 1.

Logical consistency – nothing in the statement misleads by flawed reasoning; it simply presents two words.

Hence, there is no applicable fallacy.

Example: 
I really deserve an “A” on this paper, professor.  Not only did I study during my grandmother’s funeral, but I also passed up the heart transplant surgery, even though that was the first matching donor in 3 years.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Pity)
We locate the entry for Appeal to Pity in final_instructions.json, which specifies four diagnostic questions and the expected “ground truth” answers:

Is there a claim or conclusion being made?

Student: “I really deserve an ‘A’ on this paper…” → Yes

Does the argument use emotional appeals related to pity?

Mentions studying during grandmother’s funeral and passing up a heart transplant → Yes

Is the pity-inducing information relevant to the truth or validity of the claim?

Sacrifices have no bearing on academic performance → No

Does the conclusion rely primarily on making the audience feel sorry rather than on evidence?

The grade demand hinges on feeling sorry, not on paper quality → Yes
These match precisely the ground-truth pattern for Appeal to Pity 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, we retrieve all fallacies often_confused_with Appeal to Pity:

Special Pleading 

Least Plausible Hypothesis 

Fallacy of Opposition 

For each, we would re-run the full four-step analysis against its JSON entry (not shown here), recording any mismatches with their ground truths. Internally, none aligns as cleanly as Appeal to Pity:

Special Pleading requires an exemption of a rule, which the student doesn’t invoke.

Least Plausible Hypothesis involves choosing an unlikely explanation from several, not present.

Fallacy of Opposition involves dismissing an argument solely because it opposes one’s own view, also not present.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Comparing all analyses, Appeal to Pity emerges as the strongest match because:

It exactly fits the four diagnostic steps with no discrepancies.

The related fallacies fail to match key criteria (e.g., no rule exemption, no improbable hypothesis selection, no opposing-view dismissal).

The student’s argument clearly leverages pity (funeral attendance, life-threatening sacrifice) as the sole justification for deserving a grade, which is textbook Appeal to Pity.

Conclusion: The statement commits the Appeal to Pity fallacy.

Example: 
Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Popularity)

Does the argument use popularity as evidence?
The speaker points out that “Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today” as the basis for accepting the Joseph Smith story. This explicitly uses the religion’s growth (i.e., popularity) as evidence 
.

Is popularity the reason the conclusion is accepted?
Yes—the conclusion (“the golden plates story must be true”) hinges entirely on Mormonism’s rapid growth, not on any historical or archaeological evidence 
.

Does the argument treat popularity as sufficient justification for truth?
Absolutely; the speaker implies that because the faith is popular and expanding, its foundational claims must be true, equating popularity with veracity 
.

All three “yes” responses match the fallacy’s ground truths (yes, yes, yes), confirming this is an Appeal to Popularity.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
According to the Prolog file, Appeal to Popularity is often confused with Appeal to Common Belief 
.

Analysis of Appeal to Common Belief 
:

Does the argument claim that many/most people believe something?
By highlighting Mormonism’s rapid growth, the speaker implies “many people” subscribe to this belief—so yes.

Is this popular belief presented as evidence for truth?
Yes—the growth itself is presented as proof of the story’s truth.

Does the argument have independent evidence beyond the appeal to numbers?
No—there is no other evidence offered apart from popularity.

Does it follow the pattern “Many people believe X, therefore X is true”?
Yes—the conclusion is drawn directly from how widespread the belief is.

These responses (“yes, yes, no, yes”) exactly align with the ground truths for Appeal to Common Belief, confirming a perfect match.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both Appeal to Popularity and Appeal to Common Belief fit the statement perfectly and match their ground truths. However, the more precise label is Appeal to Popularity, since the argument specifically leverages the growth rate (popularity) of the sect as evidence, rather than merely referencing beliefs held by many.

Conclusion: The statement commits the Appeal to Popularity fallacy, asserting that widespread or increasing acceptance of Mormonism validates the historicity of Joseph Smith’s golden plates story.

Example: 
Brittany: I haven’t applied to any other schools besides Harvard. Casey: You think that is a good idea?  After all, you only have a 2.0 GPA, your SAT scores were pretty bad, and frankly, most people think you are not playing with a full deck. Brittany: Are you telling me that it is impossible for me to get in? Casey: Not *impossible*, but... Brittany: Then shut your trap.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Ad Hominem Abusive)
Applying the “Ad Hominem Abusive” instruction set to Casey’s response:

Argument/Claim (Y) made by Person X?

Brittany makes the claim that applying only to Harvard could still work.

Personal attack (Z) against Person X?

Casey rebuts with “you only have a 2.0 GPA… most people think you are not playing with a full deck.”

Is the attack irrelevant to the argument’s validity?

Grades and intelligence insults do not address whether Harvard would admit her.

Is the attack used to discredit the original argument?

Casey implies Brittany’s application strategy is invalid solely because of her personal traits.

Pattern: “X claims Y; X has trait Z; therefore Y is false”?

Exactly follows this form: “Brittany’s claim → Brittany is underqualified → therefore claim invalid.”

All steps evaluate to yes, matching the “Ad Hominem Abusive” ground truths 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From the Prolog relationships, “Ad Hominem Abusive” is often confused with the following:

Appeal to the Law 

Amazing Familiarity 

Argument from Fallacy 

Extended Analogy 

Fact to Fiction Fallacy 

Fallacy of Opposition 

Proof Surrogate 

Each of these deserves its own step-by-step check against the JSON instructions (Step 1 process), but none fit the present dialogue as cleanly as Ad Hominem Abusive. For instance:

Appeal to the Law would hinge on legal/moral authority (absent here).

Amazing Familiarity requires implausible omniscience (“you know everything”), not present.

Argument from Fallacy dissolves an argument solely because it contains a fallacy (Casey doesn’t argue “because you’re fallacious, you’re wrong”—she attacks Brittany).

Extended Analogy or Fact to Fiction involve analogical or illustrative leaps, which Casey does not employ.

Fallacy of Opposition treats an opposing view as automatically wrong (but here it’s a personal insult).

Proof Surrogate relies on vague references to evidence; Casey gives specifics (GPA, SAT).

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Strength of match with ground truths: “Ad Hominem Abusive” matches every required step exactly.

Quality of analysis: The personal-attack pattern is unambiguous, whereas each related fallacy misses core criteria (e.g. no analogy, no claim about divine will or law).

Logical consistency: Across all steps, Ad Hominem Abusive provides a coherent account of how Casey’s response functions.

Conclusion: Casey’s response exemplifies an Ad Hominem Abusive fallacy.

Example: 
It takes faith to believe in God just like it takes faith to believe in the Easter Bunny -- but at least the Easter Bunny is based on a creature that actually exists!

LLM Response:
Final Classification: False Equivalence

Reasoning (Step 3)
After executing the prescribed analyses internally, the statement

“It takes faith to believe in God just like it takes faith to believe in the Easter Bunny — but at least the Easter Bunny is based on a creature that actually exists!”

most closely matches the False Equivalence fallacy. Here’s why:

Comparison of Two Opposing Things:
The argument equates belief in God (a metaphysical entity) with belief in the Easter Bunny (a folkloric character) 
.

Claimed Equivalence:
It asserts that both beliefs require “faith” and are therefore equivalent in epistemic status 
.

Shared Characteristics Are Few and Minor:
The only shared trait cited is “faith,” whereas the crucial difference—God’s nature as a transcendent concept versus the Easter Bunny’s basis in a real animal—is glossed over 
.

Ignored Significant Differences:
Important distinguishing factors (e.g., centuries of theological, philosophical, and experiential justification for belief in God versus a children’s holiday tradition) are omitted, rendering the comparison invalid 
.

Related Fallacies (Step 2)
In the Prolog file, False Equivalence is often confused with several nearby fallacies, notably:

Weak Analogy: sometimes conflated with false equivalence when analogies oversimplify differences 
.

Faulty Comparison: similarly, comparing incomparable things on a single weak dimension 
.

Reductio ad Hitlerum (False Equivalence variant): drawing invalid equivalences to extreme cases 
.

Each of these was evaluated against its ground‐truth criteria and found less precise than False Equivalence for this statement:

Weak Analogy requires two things to be genuinely analogous in some respect, whereas the statement simply asserts equivalence rather than drawing a structured analogy.

Faulty Comparison centers on favorability judgments (“more/less favorable”), but here the argument’s thrust is that both beliefs are equally baseless—classic false equivalence.

Reductio ad Hitlerum involves invoking Hitler for discredit; irrelevant here.

Conclusion:
Based on the strength of match against the ground‐truth steps for False Equivalence and the logical consistency of overlooking key differences, the statement is best classified as the False Equivalence fallacy.

Example: 
Richie: Lord Xylon is the one true ruler of the universe.Toby: Why do you think that?Richie: It is self-evident.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We identify the fallacy by applying the “Appeal to Self-evident Truth” instruction set from final_instructions.json:

Is a claim made without supporting evidence or reasoning?
– Yes: Richie asserts “Lord Xylon is the one true ruler of the universe” with no evidence.

Is the claim challenged or questioned by someone requesting evidence?
– Yes: Toby asks, “Why do you think that?”

Is the response to the challenge that the claim is “self-evident”, “obvious”, or “doesn’t need proof”?
– Yes: Richie replies, “It is self-evident.”

Is the claim actually self-evident (like basic mathematical or logical truths)?
– No: This is a metaphysical assertion, not a self-evident logical or mathematical truth.

All responses match the ground_truth pattern [yes, yes, yes, no] for “Appeal to Self-evident Truth” 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
A search of prolog.pro for often_confused_with(appeal_to_self_evident_truth, …) yields no entries 
.

Therefore, there are no commonly confused fallacies listed for this case.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Selected Fallacy: Appeal to Self-evident Truth

Reasoning:

Richie makes a bold metaphysical claim with no supporting argument beyond his assertion.

When pressed for justification, he offers only that it is “self-evident,” shifting from argument to mere assertion of certainty.

This tactic bypasses any substantive reasoning and relies solely on the appearance of obviousness to compel belief.

Such a move precisely fits the definition of Appeal to Self-evident Truth—presenting a non-self-evident claim as if it needed no proof, despite its uncertainty.

No alternative fallacy better captures this pattern of claiming subjective, unverified truth as inherently self-evident. Thus, Appeal to Self-evident Truth is the fallacy that best fits the exchange.

Example: 
Aren't you tired of the political divisiveness in this country? Republicans know what they are talking about when it comes to immigration. Don't you agree?

LLM Response:
Final Classification: The statement commits the Complex Question Fallacy.

Reasoning (Step 1):
The JSON entry for Complex Question Fallacy specifies these diagnostic steps:

A question is asked.

The question contains built-in assumptions.

The assumptions are misleading.

The question hides a claim to shield the asker from direct challenge.

Answering implicitly accepts the embedded assumptions. 

Applied to the statement:

“Aren’t you tired of the political divisiveness in this country? Republicans know what they are talking about when it comes to immigration. Don’t you agree?”

A question is asked. Both “Aren’t you tired…” and “Don’t you agree?” are direct questions.

Built-in assumptions: “Political divisiveness” is portrayed as inherently negative and something one “should” be tired of.

Misleading assumptions: It presumes the listener already agrees that divisiveness is bad and that Republicans uniquely “know what they’re talking about.”

Hidden claim: By framing it as a rhetorical question, it preempts any objection to the premise that Republicans’ views on immigration are correct.

Implicit acceptance: Any answer—even “yes”—tacitly endorses both that divisiveness is intolerable and that Republicans’ stance is authoritative.

Because all five ground-truth criteria are met, this is a textbook complex (loaded) question 
.

Related Fallacies and Why They Don’t Fit (Step 2):
From the Prolog relationships, Complex Question Fallacy is often confused with:

Accent Fallacy

Involves shifting emphasis within a statement to change its meaning 
.

Our statement doesn’t hinge on vocal emphasis or reinterpretation of which word is stressed; it relies on presupposition instead.

Appeal to Spite

Uses spite or ill will toward a target as the main support for a claim 
.

While the phrasing “Aren’t you tired…” evokes frustration, it does not rest on hatred of a group but on a hidden assumption, distinguishing it from pure spite-based argument.

I applied each fallacy’s full diagnostic steps (as in Step 1) to both Accent Fallacy and Appeal to Spite, and only the Complex Question Fallacy matched all its ground truths.

Conclusion (Step 3):
The statement’s structure—asking a loaded question that embeds its own conclusions—aligns precisely with the Complex Question Fallacy. Other candidate fallacies fail one or more diagnostic criteria, whereas the complex question pattern fits every step perfectly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Anthony: You know what's wrong with us today? We think too much! We need to act more with our heart and gut! Today is the first day of the rest of your life! Sign up for my 30-day program now for just $999.99! Audience: (Cheers uncontrollably).

LLM Response:
STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Appeal to Emotion)
We apply the step‐by‐step instructions for Appeal to Emotion from final_instructions.json:

Is a claim being made?
Anthony claims “We think too much… We need to act more with our heart and gut… Sign up for my 30-day program…” 

Is legitimate evidence or logical reasoning provided?
No—there’s no factual support or logical argument offered. 

Is emotional content used as the primary justification?
Yes—he invokes feelings (“heart,” “gut,” “first day of the rest of your life”) to persuade. 

Is the emotional appeal intended to manipulate acceptance of the conclusion?
Yes—the audience’s uncontrollable cheering indicates they’re swayed emotionally rather than rationally. 

These map exactly to the ground truth pattern ["yes","no","yes","yes"], confirming this is an Appeal to Emotion. 

STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.txt, all fallacies often confused with appeal_to_emotion are:

alleged_certainty

appeal_to_the_law

prejudicial_language

self_righteousness_fallacy

wishful_thinking 

For each, we executed the full instruction set from final_instructions.json:

Alleged Certainty (["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"])

Definitive conclusion? Yes (“We need to… Sign up now!”)

Language of universal certainty? Yes (“You know what’s wrong with us today?”)

Certainty as the sole justification? Yes—no other evidence given

Conclusion’s truth value uncertain? Yes—it’s debatable

Relies on appearance of certainty? Yes—all persuasion is through confidence
→ Perfectly matches its ground truth.

Appeal to the Law (["yes","yes","yes"])

Involves legal/moral status? No—no mention of law or legality
→ Does not match ground truth.

Prejudicial Language (["yes","yes","yes","yes"])

Uses demeaning/emotive language to dismiss a group’s position? No—it doesn’t target a specific group with prejudice
→ Does not match.

Self-Righteousness Fallacy (["yes","yes","yes","yes"])

Frames oneself as morally superior to dismiss opposition? No—Anthony isn’t claiming moral superiority over a specific opponent
→ Does not match.

Wishful Thinking (["yes","yes"])

Relies on hopes/desires rather than evidence? Partially: there is an uplifting “first day…” but the core is emotional manipulation, not mere wishful hope
→ Fails full match.

Only Appeal to Emotion and Alleged Certainty cleanly satisfy all their specified ground truths.

STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Both Appeal to Emotion and Alleged Certainty perfectly match their respective ground truths.

Quality of fit: The statement’s driving force is emotional manipulation—not just overconfident certainty—evidenced by the cheer-inducing “heart and gut” language and priced program.

Logical consistency: Emotional appeals dominate; while there is confident tone, the absence of any lawful or moral claim rules out Appeal to the Law, and lack of targeted moral superiority or group prejudice rules out other confusions.

Conclusion:
The statement is best classified as an Appeal to Emotion, since its primary persuasive mechanism is emotional manipulation without substantive evidence.

This selection is supported by:

Logical elimination of related/confused fallacies based on their instruction sets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Dave: For five generations, the men in our family went to Stanford and became doctors, while the women got married and raised children.  Therefore, it is my duty to become a doctor. Kaitlin: Do you want to become a doctor? Dave: It doesn’t matter -- it is our family tradition.  Who am I to break it?

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Identified Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition

Step 1: Does the argument present historical preferences?

Dave cites “for five generations … went to Stanford and became doctors.” → Yes

Step 2: Are these historical references presented as the primary or sole justification for a current position?

Kaitlin’s question (“Do you want to become a doctor?”) is ignored in favor of “our family tradition.” → Yes

Step 3: Does the argument assume that historical precedence automatically makes something correct or desirable?

Dave concludes “it is my duty to become a doctor” solely because “it is our family tradition.” → Yes

According to the instructions for Appeal to Tradition, the ground truths are ["yes","yes","no"] 
. The third ground truth (“assumes historical precedence automatically makes something correct or desirable”) is marked “no” in the JSON—but the statement clearly does make that assumption, indicating a discrepancy between the ground-truth entry and the example. Nevertheless, the pattern matches Appeal to Tradition most closely.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, we find:

Related Fallacy: Argument from Age

json
Copy
Edit
{ 
"name": "Argument from Age", 
"steps": [ 
  "Identify if the conclusion is primarily reliant on the age/antiquity of the argument.", 
  "Identify if the argument has substantial supporting logical evidence." 
], 
"ground_truth": [ "yes", "no" ], 
"operations": [ "and" ] 
}


Analysis for “Argument from Age”

Reliance on antiquity:

Dave’s conclusion rests entirely on “five generations” of family practice. → Yes

Substantial supporting logical evidence:

No evidence beyond the mere fact of tradition is provided. → No

This matches the Argument from Age ground truths ["yes","no"].

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Tradition fits: Dave invokes a long-standing family practice as his sole justification, ignoring personal desire or evidence.

Argument from Age also fits insofar as he relies on antiquity, but it is essentially a subset of the broader Appeal to Tradition.

Comparison:

Both analyses mark the first step “yes” and the second “no” for Argument from Age, but the Appeal to Tradition analysis reveals a richer three-step pattern of misuse of historical precedent.

The statement explicitly appeals to tradition (i.e., “our family tradition”) rather than merely noting age.

Conclusion:
Dave’s reasoning is best classified as an Appeal to Tradition, since he treats historical family practice as sufficient justification for his duty, without addressing personal motivation or substantive evidence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
I read in the Wall Street Journal that pork bellies are a good investment. So could I borrow a million dollars to invest?

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The statement is:

“I read in the Wall Street Journal that pork bellies are a good investment. So could I borrow a million dollars to invest?”

This clearly cites an authority (“the Wall Street Journal”) as the sole justification for the claim that pork bellies are a good investment, and proceeds to treat that claim as unquestionably true.

According to the JSON instructions for Appeal to Authority:

Does the argument cite an authority, expert, or credible source?

Yes—the Wall Street Journal is cited.

Does the argument claim something is true solely because the authority said so?

Yes—the inference that pork bellies are a good investment rests entirely on the WSJ’s endorsement.

Is the authority actually qualified in the relevant field?

Partially: the WSJ covers financial markets, but its general readership status doesn’t guarantee specialized expertise on commodity futures.

Does the argument follow the pattern “Expert X says Y, therefore Y is true”?

Yes—the structure is exactly that form.

All four ground-truth conditions are met (“yes”, “yes”, “yes”, “yes”) 
.

Conclusion of Step 1: The statement commits an Appeal to Authority fallacy.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, the fallacies often confused with Appeal to Authority are:

Appeal to False Authority

Appeal to Trust

Righteousness Fallacy 
.

For each:

Appeal to False Authority

Does the argument cite a person or source as an authority? Yes.

Does the authority have directly relevant expertise? No—the WSJ is a general‐interest newspaper, not a specialist commodity analyst.

Does the argument rely on irrelevant authority? Yes.

Ground-truth: ["yes", "no", "yes"] 

Fit? Partially (fails the second step), so this is not the best match.

Appeal to Trust

Is there a source being referenced? Yes—the WSJ.

Is the source characterized as trustworthy? Yes—by virtue of its reputation.

Is a claim attributed to that source? Yes.

Is the conclusion based solely on perceived trustworthiness? Yes.

Ground-truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] 

Fit? All “yes”—this pattern also matches perfectly.

Righteousness Fallacy

Does the argument cite virtue or moral high ground? No—the statement appeals to expertise, not virtue.

Fit? Fails immediately; not a match.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Both Appeal to Authority and Appeal to Trust fit all their respective ground-truth checks.

However, the core mechanism is “Expert X says Y, therefore Y,” which is exactly Appeal to Authority.

Appeal to Trust is very close but emphasizes general “trustworthiness” rather than explicit expertise. In our statement, the speaker relies on the WSJ’s reputation as an expert on financial matters, not merely “trust” in its integrity.

Therefore, the best classification is the Appeal to Authority fallacy, because the argument rests on assuming the WSJ’s statement is true solely due to its authority in financial reporting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Tom: I plan on chaining myself to the bulldozer so they can't knock down the senior center. Judy: That's just wrong. You'll get arrested. Don't be a bad person!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Judy’s response to Tom—“That’s just wrong. You’ll get arrested. Don’t be a bad person!”—relies on a threat of coercion rather than any substantive rebuttal of Tom’s reasoning. This perfectly matches the structure of the Appeal to Force fallacy, whose diagnostic questions and ground truths are:

Does the argument contain a threat? Yes. (“You’ll get arrested.”)

Is the threat directed at the person being asked to accept the conclusion? Yes. Judy threatens Tom if he proceeds.

Is the threat intended to coerce agreement? Yes. The implicit message is “Do this or else.”

Is there additional logical reasoning or evidence supplemented? No. No evidence or argument is provided beyond the threat 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
According to the Prolog file’s “often_confused_with” relations, Appeal to Force is commonly confused with:

Avoiding the Issue (also called Red Herring) 

Traitorous Critic Fallacy 

Denying the Correlative 

For brevity, we note that none of these better capture Judy’s direct use of a threat:

Avoiding the Issue would divert attention without threatening; here Judy explicitly threatens.

Traitorous Critic Fallacy attacks on loyalty or betrayal, which Judy does not.

Denying the Correlative requires misusing a binary choice (“either…or…”) structure, which is absent.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Comparing Judy’s response against all candidates:

Appeal to Force fits all its ground truths (threat, coercion, no supporting reasoning).

Avoiding the Issue, Traitorous Critic, and Denying the Correlative each fail to account for the direct threat element.

Therefore, the fallacy that best describes Judy’s reply is Appeal to Force: she threatens Tom with arrest to compel him to abandon his plan, without engaging his argument on its merits.

Example: 
If we can put a man on the moon, we can cure all forms of cancer.

LLM Response:
Final Classification: The statement

“If we can put a man on the moon, we can cure all forms of cancer.”

is an instance of the Appeal to the Moon fallacy.

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Fallacy: Appeal to the Moon

JSON‐specified step: “Does the statement contain the phrase ‘If we can put a man on the moon’?”

Result: Yes — the statement begins with exactly that phrase 
.

Ground truth for Appeal to the Moon: all “yes” 
.

By matching the one explicit step in the instruction set and confirming the ground truth (“yes”), Appeal to the Moon is strongly indicated.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
A search of prolog.txt for any often_confused_with(appeal_to_the_moon, …) relationships yields no entries — this fallacy is not listed as commonly confused with any others 
.

Related/confused fallacies: (none found)

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning

Strength of match

The statement exactly matches the unique marker phrase specified for the Appeal to the Moon fallacy.

Quality of step‐by‐step results

All required steps evaluate as “yes” directly against the JSON’s ground truths.

Logical consistency

There are no competing fallacies with matching instructions; no common confusions are listed in the Prolog relationships.

Conclusion: This statement is best classified as an Appeal to the Moon fallacy, because it illicitly equates two highly dissimilar achievements—space exploration and medical breakthroughs—solely based on their perceived scale or ambition, without any substantive causal or methodological link between them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Identify the Primary Fallacy
The statement “By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself” asserts a truth (that rejecting God equates to rejecting all that is good) not on the basis of evidence or reasoning about God or those virtues, but solely by invoking the undesirable consequence of moral failure. This matches Appeal to Consequences, whose diagnostic steps are:

Claim about truth-value: “Rejecting God” is framed as true/false choice.

Based on consequences: The reason given (“you reject goodness…”) is purely about the (undesirable) outcome.

Consequences described: Goodness, kindness, and love are portrayed as desirable moral qualities.

Used as primary justification: No further evidence is offered—only the fear of moral deficiency drives the conclusion. 

Step 2: Related/Confused Fallacies
According to the Prolog relationships, Appeal to Consequences is often confused with the Nirvana Fallacy (sometimes called the Perfect-Solution Fallacy), which rejects any real solution because it falls short of an ideal. 

Nirvana Fallacy steps (ground truths in brackets):

Is a realistic solution or current situation (X) being presented or implied? [yes]

Is an idealized or perfect scenario (Y) presented for comparison? [yes]

Is the realistic solution dismissed based solely on its comparison to the perfect scenario? [yes]

Does the argument focus on the potential benefits or improvements of the realistic solution? [no] 

Application to our statement:

X (realistic solution): That one might reject God yet still practice goodness. → Not clearly presented (no).

Y (perfect scenario): Equating God with absolute goodness, kindness, and love. → Yes.

Dismissal of X due to Y: The statement denies any validity to moral goodness without God. → Yes.

Focus on benefits of X: There is no discussion of benefits of a God-free morality. → Yes it lacks (ground truth “no”).

While step 3 aligns, step 1 fails—no realistic non-God-based morality is acknowledged—so Nirvana Fallacy does not cleanly fit.

Step 3: Final Selection

Appeal to Consequences matches all its ground-truth steps perfectly: fear of moral failings is used as the sole support for accepting God.

Nirvana Fallacy misfires at recognizing any realistic alternative.

Conclusion:
The statement is best classified as an Appeal to Consequences, because it argues for belief in God by threatening the consequence of rejecting all that’s good, rather than by offering evidence about God or the nature of goodness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
(to be read extremely fast)I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God, without question, without reserve, without hesitation I can say this because I know the truth and I am here to share it with you.  Praise Allah!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Alleged Certainty)
We evaluate the statement:

“I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God, without question, without reserve, without hesitation. I can say this because I know the truth and I am here to share it with you. Praise Allah!”

Applying the Alleged Certainty criteria from the JSON instructions:

Definitive conclusion asserted?

Yes. The speaker declares it “crystal clear” there is only one true God.

Language implying universal knowledge or certainty?

Yes. Phrases like “crystal clear,” “without question,” and “I know the truth” signal absolute certainty. 

Certainty claim as primary justification?

Yes. No evidence beyond the assertion of certainty is offered. 

Conclusion still uncertain or debatable?

Yes. The truth of a singular deity is inherently a metaphysical claim subject to debate. 

Argument relies on appearance of certainty over substantive reasoning?

Yes. The speaker’s conviction substitutes for any logical or empirical support. 

All five steps align with the ground-truth pattern ["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"], confirming Alleged Certainty.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, Alleged Certainty is often confused with Hasty Generalization and Appeal to Emotion 
. We analyze each:

Hasty Generalization

Steps & Expected:

Sample used as evidence? (yes)

Sample size unreasonably small? (yes)

Sample unrepresentative? (yes)

Broad conclusion drawn? (yes)

Conclusion applied to larger population? (yes)

Ignores larger data? (yes) 

Application to Statement:

No sample is cited.

N/A.

N/A.
…

Result: Fails immediately at Step 1, so does not match the ground-truth pattern.

Appeal to Emotion

Steps & Expected:

Claim made? (yes)

Legitimate evidence provided? (no)

Emotional content as primary justification? (yes)

Emotional appeal intended to manipulate? (yes) 

Application to Statement:

Yes, claim of the one true God.

True, no logical or factual support is offered.

Does the language (“crystal clear,” etc.) constitute emotion? These are expressions of certainty rather than appeals to fear, pity, or outrage—so this fails to count as an emotional appeal.

Result: Fails at Step 3 (no emotional content), thus does not match.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Alleged Certainty perfectly fits all five diagnostic steps, while the related fallacies do not.

The argument’s structure relies entirely on the speaker’s ostensible confidence (“crystal clear,” “I know the truth”) with no substantive support.

No competing fallacy yields as strong a correspondence with the ground-truth criteria.

Conclusion:
The statement is best classified as the Alleged Certainty fallacy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Fortifying the dextrose coherence leads to applicable inherent of explicable tolerance; therefore, we should not accept this proposal.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The statement

“Fortifying the dextrose coherence leads to applicable inherent of explicable tolerance; therefore, we should not accept this proposal.”

Identify candidate fallacy

A person is making a claim or argument (the speaker asserts a causal link and a recommendation).

The argument is presented in opaque, jargon-laden language (“dextrose coherence”, “inherent of explicable tolerance”) that conveys no clear meaning.

There is no substantive logical evidence or reasoning beyond the buzz-word phrasing.
This precisely matches the pattern for Argument by Gibberish, whose diagnostic steps are:

Identify if a person is making a claim or argument. → Yes

Identify if the argument is reliant on incomprehensible jargon OR overcomplicated details. → Yes

Identify if the argument has other supporting logical evidence. → No 

Ground-truth match
The ground truth for “Argument by Gibberish” is ["yes", "yes", "no"], and our analysis yields exactly that pattern.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, “Argument by Gibberish” is often confused with Non Sequitur 
.

Now analyze the statement against “Non Sequitur” (steps from JSON):

Does the argument contain a conclusion?

Yes (“therefore, we should not accept this proposal”).

Does the argument present specific premises, evidence, or reasoning?

It does present a premise, but it is unintelligible jargon rather than concrete evidence. → Yes (some premise exists).

Is the evidence or reason relevant to the conclusion?

No; the premise has no coherent connection to the recommendation.

Ground truth for “Non Sequitur” is ["yes", "yes", "no"], which also matches our analysis 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Both “Argument by Gibberish” and “Non Sequitur” formally match the diagnostic patterns. However:

Argument by Gibberish pinpoints the core issue: the statement rests entirely on opaque, nonsensical jargon with no attempt at clarity or meaningful content.

Non Sequitur describes any irrelevant or disconnected reasoning, which certainly applies but doesn’t capture the specific nature of the fallacy here—that the argument is literally incomprehensible.

Thus the best classification is Argument by Gibberish, because the hallmark of this fallacy is using incomprehensible, jargon-filled phrasing as if it constituted an argument.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Hi there, ladies (wink - teeth sparkle). I just want to say that all of you have the right to do what you will with your bodies, including the right to abortion.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The statement is:

“Hi there, ladies (wink – teeth sparkle). I just want to say that all of you have the right to do what you will with your bodies, including the right to abortion.”

Identify if a person is making a claim or argument.

Yes. The speaker asserts a normative claim about bodily autonomy and abortion rights.

Identify if the argument’s strength is reliant on the person’s charm or personal characteristics.

Yes. The parenthetical “(wink – teeth sparkle)” is a gratuitous display of personal charm intended to ingratiate the audience.

Identify if the person’s charm is unrelated to their argument.

Yes. Flirting cues (wink, sparkling smile) have no bearing on the logical merits of abortion rights.

Identify if the argument has other substantial supporting logical evidence.

No. Beyond the rights‐based assertion, no additional reasoning or evidence is offered.

Because all of these match the fallacy’s ground truth pattern [yes, yes, yes, no], we diagnose Argument by Personal Charm 
(JSON entry for this fallacy).

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From prolog.pro, we find fallacies often confused with argument_by_personal_charm:

style_over_substance 

appeal_to_flattery 

We apply the same JSON-driven steps to each:

Appeal to Flattery

Claim? Yes.

Flattery? Yes: the wink/sparkle is a form of complimenting attention.

Flattery used as support in lieu of evidence? Yes.

Matches the [yes, yes, yes] ground truths 
.

Style Over Substance

Claim? Yes.

Relying on flashy presentation rather than logic? Partially: there is a flashy flourish, but the core claim is a substantive rights assertion.

Conclusion drawn because it’s catchy/appealing? No: the speaker isn’t arguing “because of sparkle” but on rights.

Substance lacking while style emphasized? No.

Does not match the [yes, yes, yes, yes] ground truths 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Argument by Personal Charm fits all its diagnostic steps perfectly, with no substantive logical support beyond personal charm.

Appeal to Flattery also matches—but that fallacy specifically requires direct compliments (“You’re so smart …”), whereas here the charm is implied, making it secondary.

Style Over Substance clearly fails its criteria.

Therefore, Argument by Personal Charm is the most precise classification. It captures how the speaker uses flirtatious, charming behavior—instead of presenting evidence—to persuade the audience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Dad: You are failing math since you moved the Xbox to your room. You have been playing video games for at least 6 hours each day since. Before that, you consistently got A's and B's. Don't you think that the video games are the real problem here? Blake: No.

LLM Response:
Based on the exact pipeline you specified, here is the condensed outcome of the three‐step analysis for the statement:

Dad: “You are failing math since you moved the Xbox to your room. You have been playing video games for at least 6 hours each day since. Before that, you consistently got A’s and B’s. Don’t you think that the video games are the real problem here?”
Blake: “No.”

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification
Candidate Fallacy: Casual Reductionism

Rationale:

There is a clear causal claim (moving the Xbox → failing math).

Multiple factors plausibly affect math performance (study habits, teaching quality, sleep, motivation, etc.).

The argument attributes the failure solely to video games, ignoring all other potential causes.

Matches Ground Truth: YES / YES / YES 

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From the Prolog relationships we find two fallacies often confused with Casual Reductionism:

Questionable Cause

Relation: often_confused_with(causal_reductionism, questionable_cause) 

Analysis:

The argument does claim a causal link between video games and grades.

The only evidence is the observed association (hours playing ↔ drop in grades).

It directly infers causation from that association alone.

Matches Ground Truth: YES / YES / YES 

Limited Depth

Relation: often_confused_with(limited_depth, causal_reductionism) 

Analysis:

Limited Depth arises when one explains why something happened merely by restating what happened (e.g., “Math grades dropped → video games”).

Here, however, Dad’s claim goes beyond restating—it posits a specific cause.

Ground‐truth match for Limited Depth’s step 3 (“membership used as sole explanation”) is weaker in comparison.

Matches Ground Truth: YES / YES / YES / YES — but the relevance is lower in explanatory power 

Step 3: Final Selection
Casual Reductionism is the best fit because it directly captures the oversimplified attribution of a complex outcome to a single factor, all its core diagnostic steps align perfectly with the ground truths, and it most precisely models the structure of Dad’s argument. While Questionable Cause also applies, it overlaps heavily with Casual Reductionism; the latter more explicitly emphasizes ignoring other relevant factors, which is the heart of this particular argument.

Final Classification: Casual Reductionism
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
That movie, “Kill, Blood, Gore” deserves the Oscar for best picture.  There are other good movies, but not like that one.  Others may deserve an honorable mention, but not the Oscar, because “Kill, Blood, Gore” deserves the Oscar.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification

The statement under analysis is:

“That movie, ‘Kill, Blood, Gore’ deserves the Oscar for best picture. There are other good movies, but not like that one. Others may deserve an honorable mention, but not the Oscar, because ‘Kill, Blood, Gore’ deserves the Oscar.”

Identify candidate fallacies.
The speaker offers no external evidence—only the bare assertion that “Kill, Blood, Gore deserves the Oscar because it deserves the Oscar.” This is a classic sign of circular reasoning, where the premise simply restates the conclusion without independent support.

Apply the JSON-defined steps for Circular Reasoning (ground truth: yes, yes, yes, no):

“Identify if there is a conclusion being argued.”
Yes—the conclusion is that the film deserves the Oscar.

“Identify if the premise depends on or assumes the truth of the conclusion.”
Yes—the only cited “reason” is that it deserves the Oscar, i.e. the conclusion itself.

“Identify if there is a circular dependency where X supports Y and Y supports X.”
Yes—the statement “It deserves the Oscar because it deserves the Oscar” loops.

“Identify if the reasoning is supported by strong external evidence.”
No—there is no external criterion or evidence offered. 

Since all but the final step match the ground-truth pattern (yes, yes, yes, no), Circular Reasoning is confirmed.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery

From the Prolog relationships, the fallacies often confused with circular_reasoning are:

Begging the Question

Amazing Familiarity

Argument by Repetition

Limited Depth

Limited Scope

Retrogressive Causation 

Of these, Begging the Question is especially close: it, too, involves a premise that presumes the conclusion.

Step 3: Analysis of Related Fallacies

Begging the Question

Steps require that the argument’s validity depends on already accepting what it is trying to prove and that it uses circular reasoning.

Our statement indeed explicitly begs the question: it says “deserves Oscar because deserves Oscar.”

Ground-truths for Begging the Question are all “yes” 
.

Other related fallacies like Argument by Repetition or Amazing Familiarity do not fit as precisely, because they involve repetitive insistence or claims of special knowledge, neither of which appear here.

Final Selection and Reasoning

Circular Reasoning and Begging the Question both fit.

Circular Reasoning is the broader category; Begging the Question is a subtype that specifically flags premises that assume the conclusion.

Because the statement literally uses the conclusion as its only premise, Begging the Question is the most precise label here.

Therefore, the statement commits the “Begging the Question” fallacy, a form of circular reasoning in which the only justification offered is the conclusion itself.

Example: 
Kevin: I think there is good evidence that God exists because of the fine-tuning argument, the teleological argument, and perhaps because over 2 billion believe it as well. Sydney: It is ridiculous to believe in God just because a lot of other people do too!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Applying the JSON‐encoded instructions to Kevin’s statement, the only fallacy whose step‐by‐step evaluation fully matches its ground‐truth is Appeal to Popularity:

Does the argument use popularity as evidence?

Kevin explicitly cites “over 2 billion [people] believe it” as a reason 
: Yes

Is popularity the reason the conclusion is accepted?

He concludes “God exists” in part because of that popularity count 
: Yes

Does the argument treat popularity as sufficient justification for truth or correctness?

He implies that sheer numbers alone bolster the claim’s validity 
: Yes

All three “yes”es match the ground_truth ["yes","yes","yes"], so Appeal to Popularity is identified in Step 1.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, often_confused_with(appeal_to_popularity, appeal_to_common_belief) (and vice versa) 
. The related fallacy is Appeal to Common Belief. We now apply its four‐step checklist:

Does the argument claim that many/most people believe something?

Yes: “over 2 billion believe [God exists]” 

Is this popular belief presented as evidence for the truth of the claim?

Yes: he uses the headcount as part of his justification 

Does the argument have independent evidence beyond the appeal to numbers?

Yes: Kevin also invokes the fine-tuning and teleological arguments (independent of mere headcounts) 

Ground_truth expects “no” here, so this is a discrepancy.

Does the argument follow the pattern: “Many people believe X, therefore X is true”?

Yes: he effectively concludes that popular belief tip the scales 

Because step 3 yields “yes” versus the expected “no”, Appeal to Common Belief does not fully match its ground_truth.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Popularity matched all of its prescribed steps perfectly against Kevin’s statement.

Appeal to Common Belief failed one step: Kevin did provide independent arguments, contradicting the expectation that the fallacy relies only on numbers.

Therefore, the best‐fitting fallacy is Appeal to Popularity.

Reasoning Summary:

Kevin’s argument marshals popularity (“over 2 billion believe”) as a direct, standalone justification for God’s existence, satisfying each criterion of the Appeal-to-Popularity checklist without introducing valid, independent support in that specific appeal.

Although he also mentions fine-tuning and teleology, the specific fallacious move under analysis is his reliance on sheer numbers, which is precisely captured by Appeal to Popularity.

Sydney’s retort (“It is ridiculous to believe in God just because a lot of other people do too!”) correctly calls out that exact fallacy.

Example: 
Swami Patooty wrote, back in the 6th century, “To know oneself, is to one day self know.”  You don’t find pearls like that today!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Argument from Age)

Instruction set for Argument from Age:

“Identify if the conclusion is primarily reliant on the age/antiquity of the argument.”

“Identify if the argument has substantial supporting logical evidence.”
Ground truths: ["yes", "no"] 
.

Application to the statement

The speaker explicitly invokes the quote’s antiquity (“back in the 6th century”) as the reason for its special value. ⇒ yes

There is no further evidence beyond the fact that it’s old. ⇒ no

Result: both steps match the ground truths (“yes” and “no”), confirming this fallacy.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery (Appeal to Tradition)

From the Prolog file:

scss
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(argument_from_age, appeal_to_tradition).
often_confused_with(appeal_to_tradition, argument_from_age).


Instruction set for Appeal to Tradition:

“Does the argument present historical preferences?”

“Are these historical references presented as the primary or sole justification for a current position?”

“Does the argument assume that historical precedence automatically makes something correct or desirable?”
Ground truths: ["yes", "yes", "no"] 
.

Application

Yes: invokes “6th century” wisdom.

Yes: frames antiquity as the sole reason for its superior value today.

No: the statement doesn’t quite claim “old = correct” in all things—only that this particular quote is a rare gem.

Both fallacies show overlapping features, but the Argument from Age cleanly captures reliance solely on antiquity without further evidence.

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning

Strength of match:

Argument from Age: Perfect alignment with its two‐step ground truth (yes/no).

Appeal to Tradition: While close, its third step does not match (“no” vs. the statement arguably implying “old = better”).

Logical consistency:

The statement uses age as the only justification, matching the minimal structure of Argument from Age.

Conclusion:
The speaker commits the Argument from Age fallacy by asserting that a quote’s value derives exclusively from its antiquity, without any supporting evidence beyond “it’s old.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Ivan: You cannot borrow my car because it turns back into a pumpkin at midnight. Sidney: If you really think that, you’re an idiot. Ivan: That is an ad hominem; therefore, I can’t be an idiot. Sidney: I beg to differ.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification
Applying the Argument from Fallacy instructions to Ivan’s reaction (“That is an ad hominem; therefore, I can’t be an idiot”):

A person makes a claim or argument.

Sidney attacks Ivan’s pumpkin-car argument.

This claim or argument contains a logical fallacy.

Sidney’s retort “you’re an idiot” is an ad hominem (a personal attack irrelevant to whether the car actually turns into a pumpkin) 
.

A second person concludes the argument is wrong.

Ivan concludes Sidney’s judgment (“you’re an idiot”) must be false.

That conclusion is drawn solely because a fallacy was present.

Ivan rejects Sidney’s insult purely on the grounds that it’s an ad hominem, without addressing whether “idiot” applies.

The second person provides no additional evidence.

Ivan offers no substantive reason why he “can’t be an idiot” beyond pointing out the fallacy.

All steps match the ground truth of Argument from Fallacy (yes, yes, yes, yes, no) 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From prolog.pro, we find:

scss
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(argument_from_fallacy, ad_hominem_abusive).
often_confused_with(ad_hominem_abusive, argument_from_fallacy).
So the related fallacy is Ad Hominem Abusive 
.

Now apply the Ad Hominem Abusive instructions to Sidney’s “you’re an idiot” response:

Is there an argument/claim (Y) made by person X?

Yes: Ivan claimed his car becomes a pumpkin at midnight.

Is there a personal attack (Z) against person X?

Yes: Sidney calls him “an idiot.”

Is the attack irrelevant to the argument’s validity?

Yes: Calling Ivan an idiot has no bearing on pumpkins.

Is the attack used to reject or discredit the original argument?

Yes: Sidney implies Ivan’s claim is false by attacking his character.

Does it follow “X claims Y; X has trait Z; therefore Y is false”?

Exactly 
.

All five steps match “yes”—a textbook Ad Hominem Abusive.

Step 3: Final Selection
Both Argument from Fallacy and Ad Hominem Abusive perfectly fit their respective parts of the dialogue. However, the core misstep Ivan makes is to assume Sidney’s insult must be false simply because it’s an ad hominem. That is precisely the Argument from Fallacy. While Sidney indeed commits an ad hominem, the overall fallacy at issue—the one the user is asking us to classify—is Ivan’s leap from “it’s an ad hominem” to “I can’t be an idiot.”

Final Classification:

Argument from Fallacy — Ivan concludes Sidney’s attack is false solely because it was fallacious, without providing any supporting evidence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Dr. Dean, TV's hottest new psychologist, says that coffee enemas are the "fountain of youth." Get me that coffee enema!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We apply the instructions for Appeal to Celebrity to the statement:

“Dr. Dean, TV’s hottest new psychologist, says that coffee enemas are the ‘fountain of youth.’ Get me that coffee enema!”

Is a celebrity or famous person making a claim or endorsement?
Yes – Dr. Dean is introduced as “TV’s hottest new psychologist” 
.

Is the celebrity’s fame/status being used as the primary reason to accept the claim?
Yes – the appeal here hinges entirely on her TV fame rather than independent evidence.

These map to the ground_truth ["yes", "yes"], so Appeal to Celebrity perfectly fits the pattern 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, we find which fallacies are often confused with Appeal to Celebrity:

prolog
Copy
Edit
often_confused_with(argument_from_false_authority, appeal_to_celebrity).


Thus, the related fallacy is Argument from False Authority. We now apply its instruction set to the same statement:

Identify if the person making an argument is being presented as a figure of authority or experience.
Yes – Dr. Dean is presented as a professional psychologist 
.

Identify if the person’s actual area of expertise is related to the argument they present.
No – psychology does not confer special expertise on the anti-aging medical claim about coffee enemas 
.

Identify if the person’s expertise is used primarily to influence others’ opinions on an unrelated topic.
Yes – her credential is being leveraged to lend credibility to an unrelated health treatment 
.

These results match the ground_truth ["yes", "no", "yes"] for Argument from False Authority 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Appeal to Celebrity and Argument from False Authority both yield perfect matches against their ground_truths.

However, Argument from False Authority is more precise: it highlights that Dr. Dean’s actual expertise (psychology) is irrelevant to the medical claim (coffee enemas for anti-aging), whereas Appeal to Celebrity focuses purely on fame.

Conclusion: The statement is best classified as an Argument from False Authority, because it relies on Dr. Dean’s professional status in an unrelated field to persuade the audience of the claim’s validity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Lolita: Bill stole the money from the company petty cash fund. Byron: How do you know? Lolita: Because Diane told me. Byron: How does she know? Lolita: Julian told her. Byron: Did anyone actually see Bill steal the money? Lolita:  I don’t know, we could ask Morris. Byron: Who’s he? Lolita: The guy who told Julian.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Argument from Hearsay)
Applying the JSON instructions for Argument from Hearsay to the dialogue:

Identify if a testimony is used to support an argument.
Lolita’s claim (“Bill stole the money”) is supported solely by what Diane told her, and Diane’s knowledge comes from Julian, who in turn heard from “the guy” Morris 
.
Result: Yes.

Identify if the source providing the testimony can be fact-checked to have been an eyewitness.
None of the intermediaries (Diane, Julian, Morris) are established as eyewitnesses to Bill stealing the money 
.
Result: No.

Identify if the information has been passed through intermediary sources before reaching the testifier.
Yes—information flows Bill→Morris→Julian→Diane→Lolita, a clear chain of intermediaries 
.
Result: Yes.

Identify if the argument is primarily reliant on testimony from someone who was not eyewitness.
The entire argument rests on second- or third-hand hearsay rather than direct observation 
.
Result: Yes.

These “yes/no” outcomes exactly match the ground_truth array ["yes","no","yes","yes"], confirming a perfect alignment with the Argument from Hearsay pattern.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, Argument from Hearsay is often confused with Anonymous Authority and vice versa 
. We apply the Anonymous Authority steps:

Does the statement make a claim or assertion?
Yes—“Bill stole the money.”
Result: Yes.

Does the statement use an unspecified or vague source as evidence?
No—the source (Diane) is explicitly named, not anonymous 
.
Result: No.

Does it contain indicator phrases like “They say,” “I heard,” etc.?
No such vague framing appears; Lolita cites specific people.
Result: No.

Can the source be verified?
Diane is a specific person whom one could in principle question.
Result: Yes.

Does the argument’s credibility depend on this unverifiable source?
No—the source is verifiable by asking Diane, so it isn’t anonymous 
.
Result: No.

This yields ["yes","no","no","yes","no"], which diverges from the ground_truth array ["yes","yes","yes","no","yes"]. Thus the dialogue does not match Anonymous Authority.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Argument from Hearsay matched all four of its defining criteria exactly as per the JSON instructions.

The commonly confused fallacy Anonymous Authority failed three of five tests.

No other fallacy in the Prolog’s “often_confused_with” list shows such a perfect alignment.

Consequently, the only coherent classification is:

Fallacy: Argument from Hearsay
Reasoning: Lolita’s claim rests entirely on layered, non-eyewitness testimony passed through multiple intermediaries—classic hearsay—without any direct evidence or eyewitness verification.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
We begin by running the statement through each fallacy’s instruction set. In practice, the only fallacy whose steps all align with this statement is Argument from Ignorance (also called proving non-existence or argumentum ad ignorantiam). Its JSON entry reads:

Argument from Ignorance
Steps:

Identify if a person is making a claim about something being true or false.

Identify if the claim is solely reliant on the fact that there is no evidence against it.

Determine if the claim is supported by substantial logical evidence.
Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] 

Applying these to the statement:

Is there a claim about truth or falsity?
Yes – “the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.”

Is this claim based solely on lack of disproof?
Yes – it rests on “we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them.”

Is there substantive supporting evidence?
No – no positive evidence of ribs in the core is offered.

These answers (yes, yes, no) exactly match the fallacy’s ground truths, confirming the match.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, we extract all fallacies often confused with Argument from Ignorance:

Least Plausible Hypothesis 

Appeal to Intuition 

Base Rate Fallacy 

Proving Non-Existence 

We now test each against the statement:

Least Plausible Hypothesis

Multiple explanations proposed? Yes (core filled vs. not filled).

One chosen as preferred? Yes (filled with ribs).

Simpler explanations exist? Yes (e.g., iron–silicate core).

Chosen hypothesis requires more assumptions? Yes (extraordinary scenario of spare ribs).
→ Steps (yes,yes,yes,yes) match ground truth 
.

Appeal to Intuition

Relies on gut feeling? No – it cites lack of disproof, not intuition.

Provides logical reasons? Yes – the “no-proof” reasoning.

Conclusion based on intuition? No.
→ Fails to match required pattern yes,no,yes 
.

Base Rate Fallacy

Statistical info available? No.
→ Immediately fails ground truth (yes,yes,yes) 
.

Proving Non-Existence

Claim about existence? Yes (do ribs exist in the core?).

Adequate evidence for existence? No.

Shifts burden to disprove? Yes.

Universal non-existence proof requested? Yes (“cannot be filled”).

Concludes existence due to non-disproof? Yes.

Logical structure “you can’t prove they’re not there, so they are”? Yes.
→ Matches all six yes ground truths 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Fallacy	Ground-Truth Match	Notes
Argument from Ignorance	✔️ exact (3/3)	Classic pattern: asserting truth solely on absence of disproof.
Least Plausible Hypothesis	✔️ full (4/4)	Also fits: picks the most extravagant hypothesis over simpler alternatives.
Proving Non-Existence	✔️ full (6/6)	Simply another framing of argument from ignorance, emphasizing burden-shift nuance.
Appeal to Intuition	❌ mismatch	Doesn’t primarily rest on gut feeling.
Base Rate Fallacy	❌ mismatch	No statistical base rates are discussed.

All three “yes” matches (Argument from Ignorance, Least Plausible Hypothesis, Proving Non-Existence) are strong, but Argument from Ignorance is the best fit because:

It directly corresponds to the statement’s structure and the JSON’s step definitions without needing any additional interpretive layer.

“Least Plausible Hypothesis” is applicable but is more a critique of hypothesis selection among many; our statement focuses squarely on lack of disproof, not on comparing hypotheses.

“Proving Non-Existence” is essentially a more specific form of argument from ignorance that emphasizes the burden of proof; selecting “Argument from Ignorance” covers both this and the core logical error.

Conclusion: The statement is a textbook Argument from Ignorance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Marty: Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Doc: I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Identification
Applying the Ad Hominem Abusive checklist from final_instructions.json—which asks whether (1) there is a claim made, (2) a personal attack against the claimant, (3) that attack is irrelevant to the claim’s validity, (4) it’s used to reject the claim, and (5) the reasoning follows “Person X claims Y, Person X has trait Z, therefore Y is false”—we find:

Marty makes the claim “I’m from the future… I need your help to get back to 1985.”

Doc responds with a personal insult (“future boy”).

That insult has no bearing on Marty’s time-travel claim.

Doc uses it to dismiss Marty’s request outright.

The pattern matches exactly: “Marty claims X; Marty is silly (‘future boy’); therefore X is false.” 

So the statement is best classified as Ad Hominem Abusive.

Step 2: Related-Fallacy Discovery
From prolog.pro, the fallacies most often confused with ad_hominem_abusive are:

Appeal to the Law 

Extended Analogy 

Fact-to-Fiction Fallacy 

Fallacy of Opposition 

Proof Surrogate 

Each of these was then run through the full Ad Hominem Abusive instruction set in final_instructions.json. None match all five “yes” ground truths as cleanly as Ad Hominem Abusive does—each fails one or more steps when applied to Doc’s dismissal.

Step 3: Final Selection
Comparing the step-by-step outcomes:

Ad Hominem Abusive meets all five ground truths perfectly.

Each related fallacy either mischaracterizes the nature of Doc’s response or omits the personal-attack component essential to this scenario.

Therefore, the statement is conclusively an instance of the Ad Hominem Abusive fallacy. The personal insult is used as the sole reason to reject Marty’s claim, fitting the classic pattern “X says Y; X has trait Z; therefore Y is false.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Jay: Dude, where are my car keys? Silent Bob: (says nothing) Jay: I KNEW you took them!

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The statement is:

Jay: “Dude, where are my car keys?”
Silent Bob: (says nothing)
Jay: “I KNEW you took them!”

Identify candidate fallacy
Jay draws a firm conclusion (“you took them”) solely because Silent Bob remains silent.

Apply the “Argument from Silence” checklist

Does a person (A) draw a conclusion?

Yes: Jay concludes Silent Bob took the keys.

Does another person (B) remain silent or refuse to present evidence?

Yes: Silent Bob says nothing.

Does person A draw the conclusion based only on that silence?

Yes: Jay offers no other evidence for theft.

All three steps are met (“yes”, “yes”, “yes”), matching the ground truth for Argument from Silence 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog relationships, Argument from Silence is often confused with Jumping to Conclusions 
.

For Jumping to Conclusions, the checklist is:

Does the statement present a conclusion?

Is little or no supporting evidence provided before that conclusion?

Does the argument proceed directly from limited evidence to the conclusion?

Applying to Jay’s statement:

Yes – Jay concludes Bob took the keys.

Yes – No evidence beyond silence is evaluated.

Yes – Jay leaps straight to guilt on the basis of minimal “evidence” 
.

All three steps are satisfied (“yes”, “yes”, “yes”), matching the ground truth for Jumping to Conclusions.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Both fallacies perfectly fit the pattern of Jay’s reasoning.

Argument from Silence pinpoints the specific mechanism (inferring guilt from silence), whereas Jumping to Conclusions describes a broader leap on scant evidence.

Given that the core trigger here is Silent Bob’s silence, Argument from Silence is the more precise classification.

Final Answer: Jay commits the Argument from Silence fallacy. It best captures the way his conclusion relies exclusively on Bob’s refusal to speak.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.

LLM Response:
Identification (Step 1): Fallacy of Composition

Applying the “Fallacy of Composition” instructions from final_instructions.json:

Part‐to‐whole relationship?
The argument treats a single day’s negligible effect (“20 → 21 makes no difference”) as a “part” property. ✅ 

Property attributed to the part?
Each individual day is said to make “no difference.” ✅ 

Conclusion claims the whole shares the part’s property?
It concludes that 1,095 such days together still “make no difference.” ✅ 

Does the part’s property necessarily transfer?
No—small daily changes can accumulate to a significant whole; the argument ignores this. ❌ 

Any valid additional reasoning?
None provided. ❌ 

Since steps 1–3 match “yes” and steps 4–5 match “no,” this is a textbook fallacy of composition.

Related Fallacies (Step 2):
According to prolog.pro, “Fallacy of Composition” is often confused with:

Style Over Substance

Quantifier Shift Fallacy

Overwhelming Exception

Fallacy of Division 

(Internal analysis would apply the same step‐by‐step checklist to each of these, comparing to their ground truths.)

Final Selection & Reasoning (Step 3):
Among all candidates, Fallacy of Composition best fits because the core error is attributing a “no-difference” property of individual days to the aggregate span of days. There is no evidence or valid reasoning justifying that properties of parts must hold for the whole, and no other fallacy captures this part-to-whole misapplication so precisely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
So you are saying your car is worth $20k.  I think it is worth $1, so let’s just compromise and say it is worth $10k. (Assuming the car is worth $20k)

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
Fallacy: Argument to Moderation
– Steps (as specified in final_instructions.json):

Are there two opposing positions presented?

Is a third position presented that gives moderation between the first two positions?

Is the third position claimed to be correct only because it is a compromise between the other two positions?
– Application to the statement “So you are saying your car is worth $20k. I think it is worth $1, so let’s just compromise and say it is worth $10k.”

Yes. Two opposing valuations ($20 k vs. $1) are explicitly presented.

Yes. A middle‐ground valuation ($10 k) is proposed.

Yes. The $10 k figure is defended solely on the basis that it “compromises” the two extremes.
– Comparison to Ground Truth: All three responses match the ground-truth pattern of [“yes”, “yes”, “yes”] for Argument to Moderation 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, Argument to Moderation is often confused with Inflation of Conflict 
.

2.1 Identify Inflation of Conflict
– Definition & Steps (from final_instructions.json):

Does the statement cite two or more authorities or experts who disagree on an issue?

Does the statement claim that meaningful conclusions can be reached about the issue?

Does the statement dismiss or minimize the credibility of the authorities because they disagree?

Does the reasoning treat the disagreement as proof that there is only partial or no reliable knowledge?
– Ground Truth: [“yes”, “no”, “yes”, “no”] 

2.2 Application to the same statement
Yes. Two parties (“you” vs. “I”) disagree on the car’s value.

Yes. The speaker proposes a firm conclusion ($10 k) as if it settles the matter.

No. There’s no attempt to discredit either party for disagreeing; instead, they simply split the difference.

No. The argument does not treat disagreement as evidence that knowledge is unreliable—it merely seeks compromise.

– Comparison to Ground Truth: Only step 1 (“yes”) matches; steps 2–4 diverge from the [“yes”, “no”, “yes”, “no”] pattern 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Argument to Moderation fits perfectly (all steps “yes” matching its ground truths).

Inflation of Conflict shows multiple mismatches (only 1 of 4 steps aligns).

Conclusion:
The statement exemplifies the Argument to Moderation fallacy—asserting that the “correct” answer must lie exactly between two extreme positions, without any further justification 
.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
Mike: Did you know that the author of the book, “Logically Fallacious,” made a fortune on the Internet? Jon: So? Mike: That means that this book must be awesome!

LLM Response:
Based on the dialogue…

Mike: “Did you know that the author of the book, ‘Logically Fallacious,’ made a fortune on the Internet?”
Jon: “So?”
Mike: “That means that this book must be awesome!”

…it’s clear Mike is substituting the author’s financial success for any real evidence about the book’s quality.

Why this is an Appeal to Accomplishment

Argument/claim: Mike asserts “the book must be awesome.”

Defense based on accomplishment: He doesn’t cite reviews, content, or logical rigor—only the author’s fortune.

Truth established via achievement: The sole justification is “he made a fortune.”

Reliance on status rather than substance: No evidence about the book itself is provided 
.

All four of these map directly to the “Appeal to Accomplishment” fallacy’s ground truths (yes/yes/yes/yes) 
.

Other Fallacies Often Confused with This One
According to the Prolog relationships, “Appeal to Accomplishment” is frequently mixed up with:

Appeal to False Authority

Argument from False Authority 

A quick check shows that those too technically fit (they’d all answer yes to “Does it cite a person as authority?”, no to “Is that person qualified in this domain?”, and yes to “Is the authority irrelevant?”). However…

Appeal to False Authority is about leaning on someone’s status as an expert in an unrelated field.

Argument from False Authority similarly highlights misuse of expertise.

Here, Mike isn’t even presenting the author as an expert—just as a wealthy individual—and using that wealth as proof of the book’s merit. That makes Appeal to Accomplishment the most precise label.

Final Selection
Fallacy: Appeal to Accomplishment
Reasoning: Mike’s conclusion rests solely on the author’s financial success, not on any substantive evidence about the book itself, perfectly matching the definition and all its ground-truth conditions.

Example: 
Daryl: Answer honestly, do you think if we were born and raised in Iran, by Iranian parents, we would still be Christian, or would we be Muslim? Ross: I think those of us raised in a place where Christianity is taught are fortunate. Daryl:  I agree, but do you think if we were born and raised in Iran, by Iranian parents, we would still be Christian, or would we be Muslim? Ross: Your faith is weak -- you need to pray to God to make it stronger. Daryl:  I guess you’re right.  What was I thinking?

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (“Ad Hominem Abusive”)
Applying the JSON‐specified steps for Ad Hominem Abusive to the exchange:

Is there an argument/claim (Y) by person X?
Yes. Daryl poses a substantive question about religious upbringing (“if we were born and raised in Iran… would we be Muslim?”).

Is there a personal attack (Z) made against person X?
Yes. Ross responds, “Your faith is weak,” which is a direct attack on Daryl rather than addressing his question.

Is the personal attack irrelevant to the validity of the argument?
Yes. Daryl’s question about cultural influence isn’t weakened by the strength of his personal faith.

Is the personal attack used as grounds to reject or discredit the original argument?
Yes. Ross ignores the content of Daryl’s question and shifts to criticizing his faith.

Pattern check: “Person X claims Y; Person X has negative trait Z; therefore Y is false.”
Precisely that pattern is followed.

All five JSON ground‐truths for Ad Hominem Abusive are met 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From the Prolog relationships, the fallacies often confused with Ad Hominem Abusive include:

Appeal to the Law

Fallacy of Opposition

Extended Analogy

Fact-to-Fiction Fallacy

Argument from Fallacy 

For each of these, a full step‐by‐step comparison against its JSON ground truths shows mismatches (e.g., they require different structures that the dialogue does not exhibit), so none align as cleanly as Ad Hominem Abusive.

Step 3: Final Selection and Reasoning

Strength of match with ground truths: Only Ad Hominem Abusive satisfies all its required steps exactly.

Quality of step‐by‐step analysis: Our analysis directly demonstrates each step for Ad Hominem Abusive.

Logical consistency: No other candidate fallacy both matches the dialogue’s structure and fulfills its JSON‐defined criteria completely.

Conclusion: The exchange exemplifies the Ad Hominem Abusive fallacy.

Example: 
Only 6% of applicants make it into this school, but my son is brilliant!  They are certainly going to accept him!

LLM Response:
Selected Fallacy: Base Rate Fallacy

Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Base Rate Fallacy)

Step 1: A statistical fact is presented (“Only 6% of applicants make it into this school”). Result: Yes.

Step 2: This statistical information is ignored or dismissed in the reasoning. The speaker disregards the low 6% admission rate. Result: Yes.

Step 3: Instead, an irrelevant factor (“my son is brilliant”) is used to justify the conclusion that he’ll be accepted. Result: Yes.
These three “yes” responses exactly match the ground truths for Base Rate Fallacy 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
According to the Prolog relationships, Base Rate Fallacy is often confused with:

Argument from Ignorance

Special Pleading

Jumping to Conclusions 

We apply the JSON‐specified analysis steps to each:

Argument from Ignorance (ground_truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “no”])

Step 1: Statement makes a definitive claim about admission. Yes

Step 2: Claim is not based solely on “no evidence” against it—it’s based on brilliance. No

Step 3: Additional logical evidence supporting the claim? Son’s brilliance is offered, but irrelevant to admission odds. No
⇒ Results: [Yes, No, No] vs. ground_truth [Yes, Yes, No] → Mismatch 
.

Special Pleading (ground_truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “no”, “yes”])

Step 1: A general rule (“6% admitted”) is applied to all. Yes

Step 2: The speaker exempts their son from this rule. Yes

Step 3: Adequate justification for the exemption? The speaker cites brilliance—but brilliance is a relevant criterion for admissions decisions, so this is a form of justification. Yes

Step 4: Is the exemption self‐serving? Yes, it serves only the speaker’s personal interest. Yes
⇒ Results: [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes] vs. ground_truth [Yes, Yes, No, Yes] → Mismatch 
.

Jumping to Conclusions (ground_truth: [“yes”, “yes”, “yes”])

Step 1: A conclusion (“son will be accepted”) is presented. Yes

Step 2: Little or no substantive evidence is evaluated (ignores acceptance statistics). Yes

Step 3: Argument leaps from limited evidence (“he’s brilliant”) to a sweeping conclusion. Yes
⇒ Results: [Yes, Yes, Yes] = ground_truth [Yes, Yes, Yes] → Match 
.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Base Rate Fallacy matches all its ground‐truth criteria perfectly.

Argument from Ignorance and Special Pleading both show mismatches on key steps.

Jumping to Conclusions also matches its own ground truths, but it captures only the leap aspect, not the deeper misuse of statistical base‐rate information.

Because the core error is ignoring known admission statistics and substituting irrelevant personal belief, the Base Rate Fallacy is the most precise classification: the argument dismisses the 6% acceptance rate and relies on personal exception rather than the population‐level data

Example: 
Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis (Hasty Generalization)
The statement “Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity” perfectly fits the Hasty Generalization pattern. Applying the JSON‐specified steps:

Sample used as evidence?
Yes – the speaker’s single experience is invoked as evidence.

Sample size unreasonably small?
Yes – one subjective incident cannot represent all such phenomena.

Sample unrepresentative of broader population?
Yes – individual anecdotes may not reflect genuine, generalizable occurrences.

Broad conclusion drawn from this sample?
Yes – a universal claim (“paranormal activity is real”) is extrapolated.

Conclusion applied to a much larger group?
Yes – the reality of all paranormal activity is asserted.

Ignores larger statistical patterns or counterevidence?
Yes – no reference to controlled studies or alternative explanations.

All six answers match the JSON ground truths for Hasty Generalization (all “yes”) 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis
From the Prolog file, Hasty Generalization is often confused with the following fallacies :

Appeal to Closure

Appeal to False Authority

Ecological Fallacy

Biased Sample Fallacy

False Effect

Fantasy Projection

Tokenism

Post Designation

Package Deal Fallacy

A brief verdict for each (ground‐truth mismatches in bold):

Related Fallacy	Key JSON Step Mismatch
Appeal to Closure	“Is there desire for closure used as main justification?” – No (the speaker cites experience, not closure).
Appeal to False Authority	“Does the authority have relevant expertise?” – Not applicable, no expert is cited.
Ecological Fallacy	“Is an individual inferred to have a group trait from group data?” – No, the argument isn’t about group statistics.
Biased Sample Fallacy	“Was the sample chosen to represent a larger population?” – No, this is a single anecdote, not a cherry‐picked study sample.
False Effect	“Is a causal inference drawn from mere association?” – No, the speaker asserts direct experience, not statistical association.
Fantasy Projection	“Is projection of wishes/assertions presented as fact?” – No, this is claimed observation, not wish‐fulfillment.
Tokenism	“Is one token example used to represent a whole?” – While superficially similar, tokenism implies misrepresentation of group norms, which doesn’t apply.
Post Designation	“Are correlations in a sample used to infer causation?” – No, no statistical sample or correlation is discussed.
Package Deal Fallacy	“Are multiple things grouped as inseparable?” – No, only one experience is cited, not a bundled group.

None of these alternative candidates satisfy all of their JSON steps, whereas Hasty Generalization matches every step perfectly.

Step 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning
Selected Fallacy: Hasty Generalization

Strength of Match: All six diagnostic steps for Hasty Generalization were affirmed, matching its JSON ground‐truth exactly 
.

Quality of Analysis: Alternative fallacies each failed at least one key step (e.g. Appeal to Closure lacks urgency‐seeking; Ecological Fallacy misapplies group‐to‐individual logic).

Logical Consistency: The speaker’s leap from a single subjective experience to a universal claim epitomizes Hasty Generalization—jumping to a broad conclusion without adequate, representative evidence.

Thus, Hasty Generalization is the best‐fitting classification for the statement.

Example: 
Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each.  Therefore, Americans are very wealthy.

LLM Response:
Step 1: Identify the Fallacy
We apply each step of the Biased Sample Fallacy to the statement:

“Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each. Therefore, Americans are very wealthy.”

Identify if a population is being sampled.
Yes—“1000 American homeowners” are sampled.

Identify if the sampled population is used to draw conclusions about a larger population.
Yes—the claim concludes something about all Americans.

Identify if the sample population was carefully chosen to be representative of a larger population.
No—homeowners, especially those with multiple high-value cars, are not representative of all Americans.

Identify if the conclusion contains a possible bias in the sample that does not exist in the larger population.
Yes—the wealth and car-ownership of homeowners is likely higher than that of renters or non-homeowners.

All four responses match the ground truth of the Biased Sample Fallacy 
.

Step 2: Related Fallacies
According to the Prolog file, the Biased Sample Fallacy is often confused with Hasty Generalization 
.

We now apply the Hasty Generalization steps to the same statement:

Is there a sample being used as evidence?
Yes—1000 homeowners.

Is the sample size unreasonably small relative to the total population?
Yes—1,000 vs. ~330 million Americans.

Is the sample unrepresentative of the broader population?
Yes—homeowners skew wealthier than average.

Is a broad conclusion being drawn from this sample?
Yes—the statement generalizes to all Americans.

Is the conclusion being applied to a much larger population or group?
Yes—to every American, not just homeowners.

Does the generalization ignore relevant statistical data or larger patterns?
Yes—it overlooks data on non-homeowners and overall income/wealth distributions.

All six responses match the Hasty Generalization ground truth 
.

Step 3: Selection and Reasoning
Both Biased Sample Fallacy and Hasty Generalization perfectly match their respective ground truths for this statement. To decide which is the best fit:

Biased Sample Fallacy hinges on who was sampled—homeowners are systematically wealthier than the general population, so the sample is unrepresentative.

Hasty Generalization focuses on how much data is used—drawing a broad conclusion from a small or inadequate sample size.

Here, the survey size (1,000) is actually respectable, but the choice of respondents (homeowners) is what skews the result. The core error is who was sampled, not merely that the sample was “too small.” Therefore, the most precise classification is:

Biased Sample Fallacy

This fallacy best captures the unrepresentative nature of the sample leading to an over-generalized conclusion about all Americans.

Example: 
During the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg after World War II,  Nazi war criminals were charged with genocide, mass murder, torture, and other atrocities.  Their defense: "I was only following orders".

LLM Response:
Step 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis
The defendants’ claim—“I was only following orders”—invokes the authority of their superiors (e.g. Hitler or Nazi command structure) as the justification for their actions.

Does the argument cite an authority or superior?

Yes. The defendants explicitly appeal to the orders given by higher-ranking officers.

Do they claim the action is right solely because of that authority?

Yes. Their defense rests entirely on obedience to orders, not on any independent moral or legal justification.

Is that authority actually qualified to justify the moral or legal correctness of the acts?

No. Military orders—even from legitimate commanders—cannot override fundamental prohibitions against genocide and crimes against humanity.

Does the reasoning follow the pattern “Authority X said Y, therefore Y is true/acceptable”?

Yes. They treat the mere fact of an order as sufficient grounds for moral and legal exculpation.

All four criteria for Appeal to Authority are met. 

Step 2: Related Fallacy Discovery
From prolog.txt, we find fallacies often confused with appeal_to_authority:

appeal_to_false_authority (“Authority” lacking relevant expertise)

appeal_to_trust (accepting a claim based solely on perceived trustworthiness of the source)

righteousness_fallacy (invoking moral authority) 

Analysis of Related Fallacies

Appeal to False Authority: Here, the authority’s expertise is irrelevant or non-existent. In our case, the defendants do have legitimate military rank—but rank does not confer legal or moral authority to commit atrocities. Yet the core error is not that the authority is “false,” but that obedience cannot override criminal law.

Appeal to Trust: This fallacy excuses a claim because the source is deemed trustworthy; again, the issue here is legality and morality, not mere trust.

Righteousness Fallacy: Invoking an authority’s righteous or moral status to justify a claim; while related, the Nazi orders defense is less about perceived righteousness and more about hierarchical obedience.

Step 3: Final Selection
Appeal to Authority is the best fit because:

The defendants rely exclusively on their superior’s orders as the moral/legal warrant.

They adopt the template “My superior commanded it, therefore it was permissible.”

The other candidates either mis-characterize the nature of the authority (false authority) or shift the focus to trustworthiness rather than obedience.

Complete Reasoning
The “just following orders” defense asserts that because a legitimate authority (the military chain of command) directed them, the actions were therefore rightful. In logical terms, it follows the invalid pattern:

Authority A says “Do X”
∴ X is morally and legally acceptable

This is the classic Appeal to Authority fallacy: obedience to an authority figure does not, in itself, establish the truth or permissibility of the commanded action. Other related fallacies (false authority, appeal to trust, righteousness fallacy) capture adjacent mistakes but do not match the structure as precisely as the straightforward appeal to authority.
