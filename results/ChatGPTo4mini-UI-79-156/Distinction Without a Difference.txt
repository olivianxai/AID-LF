\#classification: Inconsistency#

For Inconsistency:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – Sergio first asserts he “would never even consider” dancing lessons, then later expresses willingness under a condition.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – the two propositions (“never consider” vs. “willing to learn”) conflict logically.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – both conflicting propositions are presented as true statements.
Step 4 evaluation: No – the inconsistency appears unintentional rather than a deliberate rhetorical choice.
