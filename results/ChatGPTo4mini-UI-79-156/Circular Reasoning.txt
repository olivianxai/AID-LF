\#classification: Circular Reasoning#

For Circular Reasoning:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – There is a conclusion being argued (“Because Brawndo’s got electrolytes”).
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – The premise depends on or assumes the truth of the conclusion (they use electrolytes to make Brawndo because Brawndo has electrolytes).
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – There is a circular dependency where the reason supports itself (X supports Y and Y supports X).
Step 4 evaluation: No – The reasoning is not supported by any strong external evidence.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/No] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/No]
