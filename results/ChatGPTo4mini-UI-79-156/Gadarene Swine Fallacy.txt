For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – The example is phrased as a question.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – It contains a built-in assumption that the daughter isn’t “like the other girls.”
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – That assumption is misleading, implying fault without justification.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – The question hides the claim of misbehavior to avoid direct accusation.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – Any answer would implicitly accept the embedded assumption.
