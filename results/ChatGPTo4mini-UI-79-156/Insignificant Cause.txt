\#classification: Oversimplified Cause Fallacy#

For Oversimplified Cause Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - a single factor (spanking) is presented as the sole cause of a complex outcome.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - the argument reduces multiple potential causes of violent behavior to just spanking.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - it frames causation in an oversimplified either/or manner.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - it assumes that because spanking contributes to murder, removing spanking would prevent murder.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - it ignores other contributing factors like environment, psychology, and social influences.
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - it treats a complex causal array as a simple direct cause-and-effect relationship.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]
