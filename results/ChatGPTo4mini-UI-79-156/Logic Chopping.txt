\#classification: Red Herring#

For Red Herring:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – John asks to move his car, Paul introduces a different discussion point, so there are multiple arguments.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – Paul’s point about all traffic slowers is only tangentially related to pushing the car, not addressing the original request.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – Paul deliberately brings up Argument B about general traffic slowing, shifting focus.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – After introducing Argument B, Paul never returns to the request for help with the car, abandoning Argument A.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – Paul’s diversion appears aimed at distracting from the original request rather than engaging with it.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]
