\#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#

For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – there is a direct question being asked.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – the question contains the built-in assumption that the respondent beats their wife.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes – that assumption is misleading, presuming guilt without evidence.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes – the question hides the claim (“you beat your wife”) to avoid a direct accusation.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes – any answer implicitly accepts the embedded assumption.
Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes/yes/yes/yes/yes]
