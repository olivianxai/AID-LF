\#classification: Quantifier Shift Fallacy#

For Quantifier Shift Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - statement contains both universal (“everyone”) and existential (“someone”) quantifiers
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - original asserts “Every person X should do something nice for some person Y”
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - conclusion asserts “There exists Y (me) such that every person X should do something nice for Y”
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - the order of quantifiers is swapped from ∀x∃y to ∃y∀x
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - this reversal changes the logical meaning of the original statement
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - the inference is invalid due to improper quantifier shift
Pattern comparison: My answers \[yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes] exactly match ground truth \[yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes]
