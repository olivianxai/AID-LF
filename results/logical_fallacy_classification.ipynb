    "I will ask you to classify the specific type of logical fallacies in the example, you will get different reward for getting the correct answer on different levels, for example, if you are able to get the correct classification on level 1, you get reward 1, otherwise you get 0. If you are able to get the correct classification on level 1, you move on to the next level, and if you are able to get the correct classification on level 2, you get reward 2, if you are able to get the correct classification on level 3, you get reward 3, and so on. The first level of classification challenge is to classify if the logical fallacy in the statement is formal or informal. The definition of formal fallacy means that there is an error in the argument's form. In contrast, informal fallacy means the arguments are logically unsound for lack of well-grounded premises. Now classify the below statement and output the results in this format: \"level_1_results:#{}#\" in all lower cases with no \"fallacy\". Only output the level 1 classification, no explanations.\n",

Under formal fallacy, there are proposition(Errors in dealing with the logical relations holding between propositions.), Quantification Fallacy (Errors in dealing with the quantifiers), Syllogism Fallacy (Errors in the syllogisms of deductive reasoning.), Probability Fallacy (Errors in dealing with probability.). Under informal fallacy, there are Ambiguity Fallacy (Errors due to linguistic ambiguity or vagueness of terms.), Inconsistency Fallacy (Self-contradiction and inconsistency occurs.), Irrelevance Fallacy (The premises are irrelevant to the conclusion.), Insufficiency Fallacy (The premises are insufficient or weak to support the conclusion.) and Inappropriate Presumption Fallacy (An inappropriate presumption is explicitly or implicitly introduced.), which one do you think it would fall under? You can also go back and change your previous classification. Output the results in this format: \"level_2_results:#{}#\" in all lower cases with no \"fallacy\". Only output the level 2 classification, no explanations. Only output a classification from the level 2 fallacy list provided in the format requested.\n",

They claimed \"liberal civil liberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights supporters bear partial responsibility...because their actions have turned God's anger against America.\" According to Falwell, God allowed \"the enemies of America...to give us probably what we deserve.\" Robertson agreed. The American Civil Liberties Union has \"got to take a lot of blame for this,\" said Falwell and Robertson agreed. Federal courts bear part of the blame, too, said Falwell, because they've been \"throwing God out of the public square.\" Also, \"abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked,\" said Falwell and Robertson agreed.\n",

      "Example #1: Let's use the example of automobile accidents since we have relatively good data on these. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, roughly 32,000 people die each year on the roads in the United States. The number of people involved in fatal accidents is roughly double that amount, meaning that about half of the people survive, and half die. Let's say that 80% of people involved in a fatal accident reach out for supernatural help. Given an even distribution among survivors and non survivors this would mean that 25,600 people who reach out for supernatural help die and 25,600 who reach out for supernatural help live to tell about it. Now we need to add in the 20% of survivors who did not reach out for supernatural help that lived: 6,400. So what we end up with is a group of 32,000 survivors, 80% of whom appear to have been saved by supernatural intervention. Of course, dead men don't tell tales, so we forget about the 80% of those who died and reached out for supernatural help and didn't get it. Because of the survivorship bias, we have a radically biased sample that leads to a fallacious conclusion.\n",
      "Example #2: The survivorship bias is used by scammers and con artists who take advantage of the \"statistically ignorant\" public. One common scam is something I call the \"prophetic investor.\" The scammer will send an e-mail to a very large group of people (say 10 million) with a claim that they have a perfect track record for picking winning investments. But they tell you not to take their word for it, let them prove it you by picking a stock a day for 7 days in a row that increases in value. Then, they say when you are convinced, call them and invest with them. Here's how the scam works: Day 1: Five different stocks are chosen, and each stock is sent to 2 million people as the winning pick. Let's say three of those stocks make money, and two don't. The 4 million people who received the stock pick that lost money are removed from the list (kind of like dying). Day 2: Another 5 stocks are chosen. This time, each stock is only sent to the \"survivors,\" about 1.2 million people each get a new pick. Out of that group, perhaps just two stocks are winners. That means that 2.4 million people got the winning stock: two days in a row! You can see where this is headed......Day 7: After the final day of sending, about 100,000 \"survivors\" remain on the list. These are people who have been sent the winning picks 7 days in a row and are convinced that the \"investor\" must be legitimate. After all, what are the chances that anyone would pick 7 winning stocks in a row with that much confidence?\n",
