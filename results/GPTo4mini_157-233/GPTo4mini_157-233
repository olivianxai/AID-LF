#classification: Complex Question Fallacy# For Complex Question Fallacy: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The question “What’s north of the North Pole?” is being asked. Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question assumes the North Pole has a "north" direction, embedding a flawed assumption. Step 3 evaluation: Yes - This assumption is misleading because the North Pole is the northernmost point; nothing can be “north” of it. Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The question hides a false presupposition to shield the asker from being questioned on it. Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Any answer would implicitly accept the flawed assumption that "north of the North Pole" is a valid spatial concept.

#classification: Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise# For Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is structured as a categorical syllogism (premises and conclusion about categories of children). Step 2 evaluation: Yes - One of the premises is negative: “If Debbie and TJ have two sons and two daughters, then they must have at least one son” implies the negation of the contrary (they don’t have no sons). Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion is affirmative: “Therefore, Debbie and TJ must have at least one son.” Step 4 evaluation: No - The affirmative conclusion does not validly follow from a negative premise in standard syllogistic form.

#classification: Existential Fallacy# For Existential Fallacy: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion. Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises use universal qualifiers ("All cats are animals", "Some pets are cats" implies "All cats are animals" and an implicit universal context). Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion uses an existential quantifier: "some pets are not animals". Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The argument assumes that because all cats are animals and some pets are cats, some pets must exist that are not animals, which introduces an existential assumption not warranted by the premises. Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth [Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes]
#classification: False Dilemma# For False Dilemma: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement presents two choices: make drinking illegal under 21 or not, implying no other alternatives exist.

#classification: Appeal to Stupidity# For Appeal to Stupidity: Step 1 evaluation: Yes – the statement dismisses reason and logic as unreliable Step 2 evaluation: Yes – this dismissal is used rhetorically to support the conclusion Step 3 evaluation: Yes – it then asserts we should not rely on reason to find truth Step 4 evaluation: Yes – devaluing reasoning makes the audience more likely to accept ignoring logic Pattern comparison: My answers [yes, yes, yes, yes] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes]
#classification: Strawman Fallacy# For Strawman Fallacy: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - there are two parties, Ted and Edwin Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Edwin misrepresents Ted’s claim as “we evolved from pond scum,” which Ted never asserted Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Edwin attacks this distorted version rather than Ted’s actual statement Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Edwin concludes Ted’s original claim is false based on refuting the misrepresentation Pattern comparison: My answers [yes/yes/yes/yes] exactly match ground truth [yes/yes/yes/yes]
#classification: Fallacy of Composition# For Fallacy of Composition: Step 1 evaluation: Yes – the example discusses a whole (chain) and its parts (links) Step 2 evaluation: Yes – it attributes a property (strength) of a part (weakest link) to the whole Step 3 evaluation: Yes – concludes the whole possesses the same property as that part Step 4 evaluation: No – the property doesn’t necessarily transfer in all part-to-whole contexts Step 5 evaluation: No – no additional valid reasoning or evidence is offered to justify the conclusion Pattern comparison: My answers [yes/yes/yes/no/no] exactly match ground truth [yes/yes/yes/no/no]
#classification: Ad Hominem Tu quoque# For Ad Hominem Tu quoque: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Jane is making an argument that smoking is unhealthy. Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Terry responds by referencing his own behavior as inconsistent with Jane's claim, implying a contradiction. Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Terry concludes the claim doesn’t apply to him, not because of evidence, but because of an inconsistency in application.

Step 4 evaluation: Yes – The denial of one disjunct (not hungry) is based solely on the affirmation of the other (hungry). Step 5 evaluation: No – The “or” here is not necessarily exclusive in logic or natural language; both could theoretically coexist under a different interpretation. Step 6 evaluation: Yes – The form of the reasoning is: “P or Q, P is true, therefore not Q.” Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/No/Yes] exactly match ground truth [Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/No/Yes]

Step 2 evaluation: Yes - This sample is used to draw a conclusion about the general effectiveness of supernatural help. Step 3 evaluation: No - The sample is not representative because dead individuals who reached out for supernatural help can't report the outcome. Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion contains bias because it only considers the survivors (i.e., those who can tell the tale), ignoring those who also sought help but died. Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes/Yes/No/Yes] exactly match ground truth [Yes/Yes/No/Yes]
#classification: Equivocation# For Equivocation: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - the term “Hister” appears in the prophecy. Step 2 evaluation: Yes - “Hister” is given multiple meanings (the Danube River vs. Hitler).

#classification: Ad Hominem Tu quoque# For Ad Hominem Tu quoque: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There are two parties: one making an accusation of racism, and the other responding. Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The responding party points out an inconsistency: the accused says he liked “Roots,” which is seen as inconsistent with being racist.

#classification: Fallacy of Composition# For Fallacy of Composition: Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The salesperson is referencing a part: Toyota manufactures four dozen cars (in the local context or display). Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The characteristic of the part is that there are four dozen cars available. Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion from the prospect ("I would have guessed they made millions") implies that Toyota as a whole (the company) must manufacture far more than that.
