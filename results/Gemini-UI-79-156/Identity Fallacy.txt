For Identity Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - S.J. Sam is making a claim about Asian people being discriminated against in tech.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Cindy responds with a counterclaim backed by research, which Sam then rejects.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Sam rejects Cindy’s counterclaim.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Sam’s dismissal is based on Cindy’s identity (not being Asian).
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Sam dismisses Cindy’s argument without addressing its content or evidence.
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - The argument’s validity is being tied to the arguer’s identity, which is irrelevant.
