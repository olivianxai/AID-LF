For Argument by Gibberish:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes – The Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense are both making a claim about electrolytes being important because Brawndo contains them.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes – The justification relies entirely on circular and nonsensical reasoning with no clear explanation of what electrolytes are.
Step 3 evaluation: No – The conversation contains no substantial logical evidence or coherent support for the claim about electrolytes.
