\#classification: Homunculus Fallacy#

For Homunculus Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement identifies a phenomenon (mental perception via eyes) needing explanation.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - An explanation (a little guy watching a movie in your brain) is offered.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - This explanation depends on the same phenomenon (a little guy seeing a movie) it is trying to explain.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The explanation is circular, requiring internal perception to explain perception.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The explanation creates an infinite regress (a little guy in the little guyâ€™s head, etc.).

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes]
