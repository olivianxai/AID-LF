#classification: If By Whiskey#
For If By Whiskey:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The congressman is responding to a question about clean water vs. new factory with two possible interpretations
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The response uses conditional structure addressing both sides: "I can appreciate the petition against..." and "I can also appreciate the new jobs..."
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The congressman supports the anti-factory side with strongly positive language about "cleanest water possible"
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The congressman supports the pro-factory side with equally positive language about "new jobs introduced in our community"
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The response presents both branches so that it seems to endorse both sides of the clean water vs. factory issue simultaneously
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - The response avoids taking a single, clear stance on the original question by appearing to support both positions
