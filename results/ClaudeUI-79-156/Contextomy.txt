For Contextomy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - David mentions an external source (BrightBert News headline) to support his claim about what the president said
Step 2 evaluation: No - The meaning out of context (president calling fat people losers) is completely different from the original context where the president was actually condemning that statement
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - David's argument relies on this out-of-context quote as evidence that the president made a cruel statement about fat people
