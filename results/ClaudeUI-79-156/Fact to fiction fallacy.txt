#classification: Relative Privation#
For Relative Privation:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement compares virus deaths (8,000/day) to total daily deaths (150,000/day)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Total daily deaths represent an extreme case (worst-case scenario of all possible deaths)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The comparison makes virus deaths appear less significant than they actually are
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion about virus deaths being insignificant is based primarily on this extreme comparison rather than objective evaluation of the virus's impact
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]
