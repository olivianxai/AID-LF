#classification: Distinction Without a Difference#
For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument states there is a meaningful distinction between "someone's pet dog" and "any member of the canine species"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based primarily on different language ("pet dog" vs "canine species member")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Both terms refer to the same thing in practice - dogs are members of the canine species, so pet dogs are included in "any member of the canine species"
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The argument's conclusion depends on this supposed distinction being valid to make the probability claim meaningful
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]
