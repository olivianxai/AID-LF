#classification: Circular Reasoning#
For Circular Reasoning:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a conclusion being argued (the dog goes through garbage because he is a dog)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The premise (he is a dog) depends on or assumes the truth of the conclusion (dogs go through garbage)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - There is a circular dependency where "dogs go through garbage" supports "my dog goes through garbage" and vice versa
Step 4 evaluation: No - No strong external evidence is provided beyond the circular reasoning
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/N]
