For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A question is being asked about frequency of wife beating
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question contains the built-in assumption that the person beats their wife
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - This assumption is misleading as it presupposes domestic violence occurs
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The question hides the claim that wife beating occurs to protect the asker from making a direct accusation
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Answering the question would implicitly accept the embedded assumption that wife beating takes place
