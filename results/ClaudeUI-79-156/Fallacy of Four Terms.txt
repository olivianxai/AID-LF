#classification: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle#

For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is structured as a categorical syllogism with two premises ("All cats are felines" and "All dogs are canines") and one conclusion ("Therefore, all cats are canines")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (cats and dogs) to different middle terms (felines and canines), and the conclusion attempts to link cats and dogs directly without a proper middle term connection
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning or evidence outside the premises that justifies the conclusion

Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/N]
