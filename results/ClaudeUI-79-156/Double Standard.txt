#classification: Special Pleading#
For Special Pleading:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The husband applies a standard (strip clubs are inappropriate for spouses) to his wife
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The husband exempts himself from that same standard when confronted about his own strip club visit
Step 3 evaluation: No - No adequate justification is provided for the exemption ("just for fun" and "that's different" are not adequate justifications)
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The exemption appears self-serving, allowing him to maintain the rule for his wife while excusing his own behavior
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/N/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/N/Y]
