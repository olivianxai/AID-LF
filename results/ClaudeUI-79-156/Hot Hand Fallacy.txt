Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Carlos attributes their winning streak to being "hot" rather than acknowledging it's based on random probability
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Carlos predicts they should continue playing to see "how long this streak will last," predicting future outcomes based on the current streak
