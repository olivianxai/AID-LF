#classification: Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable#

For Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Teri mentions something that is currently unexplained (why the stuffed animal flew off her dresser)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - She concludes that it will "forever remain a mystery," assuming it is unexplainable rather than just currently unexplained
Step 3 evaluation: No - No logical explanation is given for why it would be unexplainable; she jumps from "I don't know" to "will forever remain a mystery"

Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/N]
