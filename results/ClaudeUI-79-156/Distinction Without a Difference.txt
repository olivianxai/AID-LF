Step 2 evaluation: No - Sergio does not take a clear, definitive stance - he shifts between refusing and accepting
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The contradiction allows Sergio to retreat from his initial absolute refusal without acknowledging the inconsistency
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Sergio could be seen as 'right' either way - maintaining his standards or being open to learning
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The shift appears intentional to avoid firm commitment to either refusing or accepting dancing lessons
