#classification: Circular Reasoning#
For Circular Reasoning:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a conclusion being argued (that correlation doesn't prove masks work)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The premise depends on assuming the truth of the conclusion (that masks aren't the cause)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - There is circular dependency where the rejection of causation supports itself
Step 4 evaluation: No - No strong external evidence is provided to support the reasoning
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/N] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/N]
