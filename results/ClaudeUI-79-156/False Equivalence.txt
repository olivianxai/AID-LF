#classification: False Equivalence#
For False Equivalence:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument compares President Petutti (who ordered a military strike) to mass murderers
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The comparison claims they are equivalent ("no different than")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - They share only the characteristic of causing civilian deaths
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The shared characteristic is minor compared to significant differences (military context, legal authority, intent, etc.)
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Important distinguishing factors like legal authority, military context, and intent are ignored
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - The equivalence is logically invalid due to the magnitude of differences between authorized military action and criminal mass murder
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]
