\#classification: Gamblers Fallacy#

For Gamblers Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The situation clearly involves pure random chance (coin flips).
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Previous outcomes (five heads) are explicitly referenced.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims the next flip will “probably be tails” based on past flips.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - It assumes dependence between independent random events (coin flips are independent).

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes]
