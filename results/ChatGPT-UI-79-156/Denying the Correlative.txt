\#classification: Appeal to Force#

For Appeal to Force:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Rocco issues a clear threat (“Read my lips: do you have my money or not?” followed by the sound of a bat breaking kneecaps), which qualifies as a threat.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The threat is directed at Paulie, the person being asked to accept the conclusion (that he owes money and must repay it).
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The threat (violence) is used to coerce agreement or compliance, not through logic or persuasion.
Step 4 evaluation: No - There is no additional logical reasoning or evidence presented; only the threat supports the demand.
