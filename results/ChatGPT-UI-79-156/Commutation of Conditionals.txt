\#classification: Commutation of Conditionals#

For Commutation of Conditionals:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement is making a claim: "If I have a PhD, then I am smart."
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement contains a conditional structure: "If P then Q."
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion swaps the antecedent and consequent: "Therefore, if I am smart, then I have a PhD."
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The switched statement is asserted as true without independent justification.
Step 5 evaluation: No - The new conditional (if Q then P) is not logically equivalent to the original (if P then Q).

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/No] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes/Yes/No]
