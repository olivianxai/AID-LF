\#classification: Slippery Slope#

For Slippery Slope:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument suggests a chain reaction (getting excited → falling → cracking head) resulting from a minor initial act (not wearing a helmet during chess).
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The chain is presented as likely or inevitable, even though the initial act (playing chess without a helmet) is not plausibly linked to such extreme outcomes.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion (wearing a helmet) is based entirely on this exaggerated chain without independent justification.

Pattern comparison: My answers \[Yes/Yes/Yes] exactly match ground truth \[Yes/Yes/Yes]
