\#classification: Spiritual Fallacy#

For Spiritual Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Tracy's claim about someoneâ€™s "aura" and "subtle, luminous radiation" appears nonsensical or problematic when taken literally.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - When pressed by TJ, Tracy avoids literal clarification and reframes the aura as a "projection of negative energy."
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Tracy reframes the aura as a kind of "field" with metaphysical properties, shifting away from literal explanation.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - This shift avoids rational scrutiny, allowing her to maintain belief in the claim without empirical defense.
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The reframing into spiritual/metaphysical language defends the original claim from logical evaluation.
