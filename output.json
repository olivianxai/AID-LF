Determine if the disjunctive statement (X or Y) is being assessed as less probable than one of its individual components (either X alone or Y alone)\n\n4. Verify that this violates the logical rule that a disjunction must be at least as probable as any of its constituent parts\n\n5. Confirm that the error stems from incorrect probability reasoning rather than other logical issues\n\n',
 'Distinction Without a Difference': "\n\n1. Identify if the argument claims there is a meaningful difference between two positions, concepts, or terms (A and B)\n2. Examine whether this claimed difference is based primarily on different language or terminology rather than substance\n3.

Check if there is a conditional statement that uses a necessary truth as a premise\n\n3. Examine the conclusion to see if it claims something that is merely possible is actually necessary\n\n4. Verify if the conclusion removes or ignores the conditional nature of the original statement\n\n5. Determine if the scope of necessity has been incorrectly expanded from the conditional premise to an unconditional conclusion\n\n6.

 'Statement of Conversion': '\n\nSteps to classify Statement of Conversion fallacy:\n\n1. Identify if the argument involves someone\'s personal change of belief or position\n2. Check if the conclusion about truth/falsehood is based solely on this conversion experience\n3. Determine if the argument lacks supporting evidence beyond the personal transformation\n4. Verify if the reasoning follows the pattern: "I used to believe X, now I don\'t, therefore X is wrong" or "I didn\'t believe X, now I do, therefore X is right"\n5. Confirm that the conversion story itself is being used as the primary or sole justification for the claim\'s truth value\n\n',
 'Stereotyping the fallacy': "\n\nSteps to classify if a statement has the Stereotyping fallacy:\n\n1. Identify if the statement makes a broad generalization about a group (All X's have property Y)\n2. Check if this generalization is based on characterization/assumption rather than verified facts\n3. Determine if a specific individual or case (Z) is being categorized as part of that group (X)\n4. Verify if the conclusion assigns the generalized property (Y) to the specific case (Z) based solely on group membership\n5.

Examine the arguments, methods, or reasoning being used to disprove X\n\n3. Determine if the arguments or reasoning depend on or require the truth of X itself\n\n4. Check if the person is using X as a foundation while simultaneously claiming X is false\n\n5. Verify that the contradiction creates a self-defeating argument where the disproof relies on what is being disproven\n\n6.

Check if Person 2's restatement is:\n   - Distorted from the original\n   - Exaggerated beyond what was actually said\n   - Misrepresented in meaning or scope\n\n5. Verify that Person 2 attacks this altered version rather than the original claim\n\n6. Confirm that Person 2 concludes the original claim is false based on refuting the distorted version\n\n7. If all steps are present, classify as Strawman Fallacy\n\n",
 'Style Over Substance': '\n\n**Steps to classify Style Over Substance fallacy:**\n\n1. Identify if there is a claim or argument being made\n2. Examine whether the claim is supported by compelling language, rhetoric, or visual aesthetics rather than logical evidence\n3. Check if the argument relies on how "good" it sounds or looks rather than factual support\n4. Determine if the conclusion is drawn primarily because the claim is catchy, eloquent, or visually appealing\n5. Verify that substance/logical reasoning is lacking while style/presentation is emphasized\n6. Confirm that the argument follows the pattern: "This sounds/looks good, therefore it must be true"\n\n',

Check if there is a threat or possibility that this past investment will be "lost" or "wasted"\n3. Look for a proposal or argument for additional future investment\n4. Determine if the justification for the future investment is primarily based on not wanting to lose the past investment\n5. Verify that the argument fails to properly weigh the total costs and benefits of continuing versus stopping\n6. Confirm that the reasoning treats past costs as a reason to continue rather than treating them as irrelevant to future decisions\n\n',
 'Suppressed Correlative': '\n\nSteps to classify if a statement has the Suppressed Correlative fallacy:\n\n1. Identify if there are two mutually exclusive categories being discussed (X and not-X)\n2. Check if one person initially presents these as genuine alternatives where both options are possible\n3. Determine if another person redefines one of the categories (usually X) in a way that absorbs or encompasses the other category\n4. Verify that this redefinition makes the distinction meaningless by eliminating one of the original alternatives\n5. Confirm that the redefinition prevents legitimate examples from fitting into the "not-X" category\n6. Check if the redefinition renders the original term essentially meaningless due to over-expansion\n\n',
 'Survivorship Fallacy': '\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Based on testimonies/evidence from only "winners" or survivors\n- Ignores or cannot access testimonies from "losers" or non-survivors\n- Leads to skewed conclusions due to incomplete data set\n- Rooted in survivorship bias\n\n**Classification Steps:**\n1. Identify if the argument draws a conclusion based on testimonies or examples\n2. Determine if there are two groups: those who succeeded/survived and those who failed/did not survive\n3. Check if only the successful/surviving group\'s experiences are being considered\n4. Verify if the unsuccessful/non-surviving group\'s testimonies are absent, ignored, or inaccessible\n5.

 'Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy': '\n\n1. Identify if two or more things (X and Y) are being compared\n2. Check if multiple criteria or data points are available for comparison\n3. Determine if only certain criteria/similarities are being highlighted while differences are ignored\n4. Assess if the selection of criteria appears to support a predetermined desired outcome\n5. Verify if the pattern-finding or conclusion seems to impose meaning on what could be random data\n6. Confirm if the selective focus leads to a misleading or inaccurate conclusion\n\n',
 'Tokenism': '\n\nSteps to classify Tokenism fallacy:\n\n1. Identify if a specific problem or issue is being discussed\n2. Determine if a solution or response has been proposed to address the problem\n3. Evaluate whether the proposed solution is genuinely adequate to solve the identified problem\n4. Check if the inadequate solution is being presented or accepted as if it were sufficient\n5. Confirm that the solution appears to be a symbolic gesture rather than substantive action\n6. Verify that the token gesture is being used as a substitute for more meaningful or comprehensive action\n\n',
 'Traitorous Critic Fallacy': '\n\n1. Identify if there is criticism being made by one person against a group they belong to or are associated with\n\n2. Check if the response to the criticism attacks the critic\'s loyalty or allegiance rather than addressing the actual criticism\n\n3. Look for suggestions that the critic should leave the group or stay away from the issue\n\n4. Determine if the response uses phrases like "if you don\'t like it, get out" or similar dismissive language\n\n5. Verify that the criticism is not actually addressed on its merits\n\n6. Confirm that the respondent is deflecting by questioning the critic\'s group membership or loyalty\n\n',
 'Two Wrongs Make a Right': '\n\n1. Identify if there are two parties involved in the statement\n2. Check if one party is justifying an action they took or want to take\n3. Determine if the justification is based on the other party having done the same action to them\n4. OR determine if the justification is based on the belief that the other party would do the same action to them\n5. Verify that the reasoning follows the pattern: "Because they did/would do X to me, I am justified in doing X to them"\n6. Confirm that no other moral or logical justification is provided beyond the reciprocal nature of the action\n\n',
 'Type Token Fallacy': '\n\n1. Identify if a word or phrase in the statement can refer to both a type (abstract concept/category) and a token (specific instance/object of that concept)\n\n2. Determine if the statement shifts between discussing the type and the token without clear distinction\n\n3. Check if the ambiguity between type and token creates confusion or misleading reasoning\n\n4. Verify if responses or conclusions inappropriately switch from addressing the type to addressing the token, or vice versa\n\n5. Confirm that this type-token confusion affects the validity of the argument or statement\n\n',
 'Unfalsifiability': '\n\n**Steps to identify Unfalsifiability fallacy:**\n\n1. Identify if a claim is being asserted as definitively true or false\n2. Determine if the claim can be tested through observation or physical experiment\n3. Check if there exists any possible evidence that could contradict or disprove the claim\n4. Assess whether the assertion is made with confidence despite lack of testable evidence\n5. Verify if the claim moves beyond the realm of empirical verification into faith-based territory\n6. Confirm that the statement cannot be demonstrated false under any conceivable circumstances\n\n',
 'Unwarranted Contrast': '\n\n**Steps to classify Unwarranted Contrast fallacy:**\n\n1. Identify if the argument involves a statement about "some" members of a group having a particular property\n2. Check if the argument then concludes that "some" members of that same group do NOT have that property (or vice versa)\n3. Determine if this conclusion is drawn solely based on the implicature (what is suggested) rather than the logical implication (what is actually stated)\n4. Verify that the arguer is treating an implicature as if it were a logical implication\n5. Confirm that the contrast being drawn is unwarranted because the original statement doesn\'t logically require the opposite to be true\n\n',
 'Use Mention Error': '\n\n**Steps to identify Use Mention Error fallacy:**\n\n1. Identify if the statement involves a word or term being discussed\n2. Check if the word itself (the mention) is being confused with what the word refers to (the use)\n3. Look for missing quotation marks around words that should be treated as words rather than their referents\n4. Determine if the argument treats "X" (the word) as equivalent to X (the thing the word describes)\n5. Verify if this confusion between word and referent creates an invalid logical connection\n6. Check if this error is being used to create a false equivalence or equivocation\n\n',
 'Weak Analogy': '\n\nSteps to classify Weak Analogy fallacy:\n\n1. Identify if an analogy is being used to support an argument\n2. Determine what two things are being compared (X and Y)\n3. Check if a property or characteristic (P) is attributed to Y\n4. Verify if the argument concludes that X also has property P based on the analogy\n5. Evaluate the degree of similarity between X and Y\n6. Assess if the differences between X and Y outweigh the similarities\n7. Determine if the dissimilarities are significant enough to make the analogy ineffective for the argument\n8. If the analogy is more dissimilar than similar in relevant aspects, classify as Weak Analogy fallacy\n\n',

Determine if contradictory evidence or information (Y) is presented to them\n3. Check if the person actively refuses to examine or consider the conflicting evidence\n4. Verify that the refusal is motivated by a desire to maintain their existing belief\n5. Confirm that the person concludes their original belief remains true despite refusing to engage with counter-evidence\n6. Ensure the rejection is based on willful avoidance rather than legitimate criticism of the evidence quality\n\n',
 'Wishful Thinking': '\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Desire or wanting something to be true substitutes for actual evidence\n- Personal wishes treated as proof of reality\n- Cognitive bias that distorts evaluation of evidence based on preferred outcomes\n\n**Classification Steps:**\n1. Identify if the argument contains a desired outcome or wish\n2. Check if this desire is being used as evidence or justification\n3. Determine if actual supporting evidence is absent or inadequate\n4. Verify that the conclusion relies primarily on the person\'s wanting it to be true\n5. Confirm the logical structure follows "I wish X were true, therefore X is true"\n\n'}
